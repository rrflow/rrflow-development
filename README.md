# RRFlow

RRFlow is one reasoning-data engine for AI governance, reasoning, recall, and
bounded context assembly. RRD is its embedded and daemon runtime; rrflowDB,
rrflowKV, rrflowMX, rrflowQL, Arrow/DataFusion, graph, lexical, vector,
inference, and client capabilities remain parts of that one system.

This README is the bootstrap product entry point and knowledge map. It owns
RRFlow's identity, non-negotiable architecture invariants, and current status;
it delegates each detailed subject to exactly one linked memory record. The
RRFlow 1.0 release checklist is owned by
[`docs/roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md`](docs/roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md). Supporting records
may explain or prove an owner, but cannot override it.

The target release-train version is `1.0.0`. It is frozen while the alpha
baseline is established. Current maturity is **pre-alpha**. The version is a
contract line, not a claim that the complete system is stable, optimized, or
release-ready.

## Current status

The persistent rrflowDB target is not complete or alpha-qualified. Existing
types, crates, tests, rrflowKV persistence, rrflowMX execution, rrflowQL, and
DataFusion integration are implementation inventory—not proof that the target
engine flow is finished. The exact present-versus-target boundary is maintained
in [Current implementation boundary](docs/architecture/engine-data-flow.md#current-implementation-boundary),
and all observed deficiencies are maintained in the
[POA&M](docs/poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha.md#open-deficiencies).

The canonical checklist and accepted evidence are in the
[release roadmap](docs/roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md#rrflow-10-execution-checklist).
A-06 is complete: the checkout knowledge package is classified,
content-addressed, reproducible, and ready for later authorized import. A-07 is
also complete: every current package/capability family is mapped to its
canonical destination; package, type, path, dependency, and repository-source
boundaries are frozen; and the 13-boundary causal-evidence vocabulary now has
closed operation, typed-link, type-checked attribute, propagation, and
diagnostic-export rules. Exact current trace names and attributes that await
their behavior-owning C-through-I gates are finite shrinking inventories, not
alternate APIs. This completes structural and evidence vocabulary only; it
does not qualify persistence, native indexes, DataFusion streaming, reasoning,
installation, or cross-surface observability. B-01 through B-05 are complete:
router model artifacts, tokenizer, output schema, capabilities, resource
limits, runtime ABI/device, quantization, and deterministic grammar now fail
closed before model loading. One authenticated `/v1/ws` connection now carries
the closed, bounded request, cancellation, subscription, delivery, ACK,
heartbeat, error, and backpressure vocabulary; the Rust client/server proof
covers multiplexed durable subscriptions, exact replay coordinates, and
malicious peers. Generic operation execution remains fail-closed until H-04;
GraphQL now parses and validates against a read-stamped schema catalogue and
lowers into the same bound rrflowQL `Query` representation, with no resolver,
storage call, authorization bypass, or second executor. Its outward HTTP
surface remains H-04 work. C-01 and C-02 are complete: live rrflowKV
application keys use the manifest-authenticated `RRKV0001` ordered codec, and
one snapshot-isolation transaction port now backs the claim, control,
projection, runtime, and invocation repositories for both rrflowMX and
rrflowKV. The broad profile-specific semantic store implementations are gone.
C-03 is also complete: one storage-neutral semantic plan now commits temporal
records and relations, both graph directions, schema-bound scalar/unique
changes, BM25/vector source deltas, runtime state, durable projection work,
governed-function receipts and proposals, semantic audit, outbox, cursor, and
outcome through one rrflowMX/rrflowKV transaction. The rrflowKV fault matrix
proves all-or-none recovery at prepared, WAL-appended, WAL-synced, and visible-
before-acknowledgement boundaries; public function-catalogue limits fit one
physical batch; corrupt runtime-build substitution fails closed; and a durable
receipt closes a lost acknowledgement without guest re-execution. C-04 is
also complete: current and temporal state is selected through authenticated,
budgeted semantic-version point/range reads at one `ReadStamp`; normal query,
vector, retrieval, context, memory, and inference paths no longer reconstruct
state from the runtime change log; and exact rrflowMX/rrflowKV, rrflowKV
reopen, physical-counter, and source-closure evidence passes. C-05 is complete
for the single-node alpha composition: retired physical readers are absent;
`rrd-store` is the only required production owner of `rrd-lsm`; schemas require
one explicit logical table map; and every persisted vector requires its
canonical collection plus named-vector address. The generic vector artifact
catalogue now admits only exact/compact and HNSW projections. Scalar, product,
binary, and TurboQuant artifacts enter the same serving planner only through
their explicit build/activate/retire quantization lifecycle; the duplicate
TurboQuant `ensure_vector_index` request, generic publication, replay
suppression, and successful fixtures are gone. The complete default workspace
test and strict Clippy matrices pass after that convergence. The unavailable
post-alpha OpenRaft implementation remains an explicit POA&M item and is not
part of the alpha composition. C-06 is complete: segment v6 supplies the ordered
key/version spine, six Arrow-layout page buffers, authenticated format and
writer-policy identities, measured mapped-versus-allocated ownership, and
authenticated configurable row-group targets applied by flush and compaction.
Its default writer independently retains each page raw or encodes it as an LZ4
block only when the authenticated 12.5-percent saving threshold is met; the
explicit `none` policy remains available. Stored bytes are authenticated before
bounded decoding, raw mmap pages may be borrowed, and compressed pages become
owned aligned Arrow buffers with decompression charged separately. Persisted,
authenticated row-group Bloom filters survive normal reopen without
semantic-page reads, prune definite point misses before key-page acquisition,
and remain acceleration metadata: positives still use the exact MVCC spine.
C-06g adds
a synchronous bounded projected storage stream over an owned sequence,
manifest, memtable, and segment generation. It selects key-spine pages first,
resolves one MVCC winner, suppresses winning tombstones, defers value pages by
projection, emits bounded Arrow-compatible buffers, pins the manifest closure
through cancellation/drop, and reports query work separately from segment-open
validation and rrflowKV startup reconciliation. Fixed and generated mixed-
family histories match the independent oracle through reopen and protected
compaction. C-06h now adds deterministic independent-model, stress, fault,
lifetime, and coverage-guided sanitizer qualification over that stream. The
integrated C-06i compression corpus proves exact none/adaptive semantics,
reopen and compaction behavior, raw/compressed ownership, bounded malformed
decode rejection, and 1,418,038 stored bytes for 8,988,877 logical page bytes
on one clean Linux revision. C-06j completes the physical-policy decision with
one family-neutral, exact-byte cache: scan-resistant probationary/protected LRU
is the default, exact LRU remains a selectable oracle/operator policy, and one
opaque engine-generated projected-stream scope prevents a scan from promoting
its own repeated page touches. On clean revision `5b1c31d`, the same persisted
eight-family corpus produced 48 post-scan hot-page loads under exact LRU and
zero under scan-resistant LRU, while recording 18,200 same-scope suppressions,
48 cross-operation promotions, 48 protected entries, identical manifest,
semantic, and projected-row digests, and exact 1 MiB capacity compliance.
Measured evidence rejects value separation, semantic-family cache partitions,
Moka, TinyLFU, and caller-controlled cache bypass for this accepted format.
D-01 remains open and is the active executable item. Its first bounded
prerequisite now exists: a source-built primary `rrflow` 1.0.0 executable can
deterministically preview and apply a fresh or existing local-project
installation, serve the generated public contract, complete an authenticated
readiness challenge, and perform mutation-free quick verification. The linked
[walking-product journal](docs/evidence/change-journals/gate-d/d-01-installed-ui-walking-product.md)
records the exact limits and evidence. The next bounded prerequisite also now
establishes one canonical project-local `.rrflow` estate, a portable locator,
owner-only credential and storage roots, and one sealed
`EstateConfiguration`. Installation can accept a bounded TOML input at plan
time; apply uses only the sealed plan; installed open and server discovery bind
the same project/estate/instance identity, independent deployment coordinates,
configuration revision, digest, and reasoning/recall/query ceilings. A real
process rejects over-ceiling query work as resource exhausted before executing
it. The linked
[canonical-estate journal](docs/evidence/change-journals/gate-d/d-01-canonical-estate-layout-and-configuration.md)
records the exact implementation and tests. A third bounded prerequisite now
makes that sealed installation the only product startup authority. The same
plan resumes after deterministic interruptions at each of eight durable stages
without changing its first-apply time or duplicating its token, credential,
installed record, audit, checkpoint, or locator. The primary CLI, internal
server process, embedded MCP mode, six-language SDK conformance daemon,
deployment catalogue, and Kubernetes renderer now enter through installed
state; the pre-canonical manifest, private project binding, raw product CLI,
standalone security initializer, development supervisor, and server initializer
were removed directly. The linked
[authority-convergence journal](docs/evidence/change-journals/gate-d/d-01-precanonical-authority-convergence-and-install-recovery.md)
records the exact replacement and limits. The reasoning runner remains
truthfully unavailable. This is still not a streamed DataFusion `RecordBatch`
provider, native graph/BM25/vector access, complete attunement, turnkey release
distribution, or persistent reasoning/recall proof.

The source-built walking product is not yet a releasable installed
distribution. The primary executable now composes `version`, `install plan`,
`install apply`, `serve`, authenticated `ready`, and read-only
`verify --level quick`; its help and parser reject the removed raw-database and
development commands. Repair, restore, uninstall, durable attunement execution,
and release service management remain absent. The retained internal server and
adapter binaries open only an already-installed estate, but they are not a
second supported operator command tree. No signed/offline-complete platform
bundle or native Windows
`rrflow.exe` has been built and run. D-01 owns the remaining single-executable
walking lifecycle, D-11 owns complete repair/restore/uninstall, and Gate J owns
native signed platform distributions. See the
[installed lifecycle](docs/reference/deployment/installed-lifecycle.md) and
[POA&M](docs/poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha.md).
