//! Protocol-first cluster contracts for Rrd.
//!
//! It freezes the placement, consistency, snapshot-vector, routing, transfer,
//! and transaction-scope contracts and supplies a deterministic failure
//! simulator. The optional `openraft-adapter` feature adds a real consensus
//! engine, atomic canonical runtime application, and Rrd-native durable store,
//! including authenticated runtime-bearing snapshot transfer across physically
//! separate local-Raft and canonical-state domains. The further opt-in
//! `openraft-transport` feature adds identity-bound TLS 1.3 RPCs, complete-state
//! credential reload/revocation, and a process-isolated node runner, but
//! production Multi-AZ capability remains denied until independent-host
//! hardware fault and automatic workload-identity evidence pass the invariants.
