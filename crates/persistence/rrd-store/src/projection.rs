//! The current-state projection over the claim log. `SPEC.md` §8.2 and §8.3.
//!
//! The projection holds the newest recorded version per (subject, predicate)
//! pair — "newest" by (valid_from, tx_time), matching the key encoding's
//! ordering. It is derived state and MUST NOT be treated as authoritative
//! (§8.2): its whole value is that it can be rebuilt from the sequence index
//! and *differenced against that rebuild*.
//!
//! Three invariants carry this module:
//!
//! 1. **The watermark advances in the same write as the projection** (§8.2).
//!    Both live in one serialized blob under one key, so a crash mid-rebuild
//!    leaves the old blob with the old watermark and the interval is replayed,
//!    never skipped. Replay is safe because the fold is idempotent.
//! 2. **Grounding recomputes at the projection's own watermark**, not at the
//!    current sequence. Grounding verifies that incremental maintenance equals
//!    batch recomputation over the same interval; lag beyond the watermark is
//!    rebuild's dimension, and conflating the two would report honest lag as
//!    divergence. §8.3's `as_of = now` is reached by rebuilding first, which
//!    is what the operator `ground` command does.
//! 3. **Divergence halts; it is never repaired** (§8.3). A quarantined
//!    projection refuses reads and rebuilds until the operator explicitly
//!    resets it. The quarantine write is Authoritative — the one derived-state
//!    write that pays for an fsync — because a detected divergence that a
//!    crash could silently forget would defeat the detection.
