//! Group-commit writer.
//!
//! `SPEC.md` §8.1. Claims arriving individually are buffered and committed in
//! batches, so that a continuously writing executor pays amortized rather than
//! per-claim durability cost.
//!
//! ```text
//! flush when   batch full   OR   flush_delay elapsed   OR   flush() invoked
//! ```
//!
//! ## Durability contract
//!
//! - After [`Writer::flush`] returns `Ok`, every claim submitted before that call
//!   is durable.
//! - Before `flush` returns, a submitted claim MAY be lost on process
//!   termination. This is the documented and tested boundary; see
//!   `tests/durability.rs`.
//!
//! ## Choosing a pattern
//!
//! Measured on ext4, 2026-08-10 (`examples/sparse_latency.rs`,
//! `examples/throughput.rs`). The interval only amortizes when claims arrive
//! while a batch is open; it cannot batch a producer that waits for each claim.
//!
//! | Producer | Pattern | Cost per claim |
//! |----------|---------|----------------|
//! | Continuous, does not await durability | `submit` repeatedly, `flush` at a task boundary | 0.0055 ms |
//! | Requires durability before proceeding | `submit` then `flush` | 0.438 ms |
//! | Requires durability before proceeding | `submit`, then block on [`Writer::durable_through`] | 21.264 ms at a 20 ms interval |
//!
//! The third row is an anti-pattern. Blocking on `durable_through` waits out the
//! full interval for a batch that will never fill, so it pays the interval as
//! latency and gains no amortization. [`Writer::flush`] commits immediately and
//! bypasses the interval; its cost is independent of `flush_delay`.
//!
//! [`Writer::durable_through`] is provided for progress reporting, not as a
//! synchronization primitive.
//!
//! ## Backpressure
//!
//! The queue is bounded. [`Writer::submit`] blocks when the queue is full rather
//! than growing without limit, so a producer faster than the substrate is slowed
//! rather than exhausting memory. Blocking occurrences are counted in
//! [`WriterStats::backpressure_waits`], which is the signal for tuning
//! [`WriterConfig::queue_capacity`] from evidence rather than assumption.
//!
//! Implemented on `std` synchronization only. The kernel and this adapter carry
//! no async runtime.
