//! Canonical semantic repositories over the one physical storage transaction.
//!
//! Repositories own key selection, decoding, validation, and semantic mutation
//! planning. They borrow a [`StorageEngine`](crate::StorageEngine), but the
//! engine exposes no semantic read or write methods of its own. rrflowMX and
//! rrflowKV therefore execute the same repository code and differ only in
//! volatility and physical durability.
