//! Removal candidacy. `SPEC.md` §7 and §12.
//!
//! Removal must be decidable by query rather than by argument. This module
//! derives candidates by joining the stored subject-predicate pairs against the
//! access records within a stated interval.
//!
//! Analysis only. No removal path exists, and none is specified: what becomes of
//! a retired claim, and how removal interacts with promotion, are not settled.
//! The report states what is unreferenced; the decision remains the operator's.
