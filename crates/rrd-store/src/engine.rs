//! The storage port. `PLAN.md` Step S: the ability to fold in storage.
//!
//! rrflow's value is the semantic layer — bi-temporal claims, durability
//! classes, projections that ground against their log, recall, the ledger.
//! The engine underneath is a *port*: eight primitives (append, sequence,
//! range, subjects, observe, projection get/put, and the `ClaimSource`
//! reads) that any backend can supply. Everything else — assert,
//! current-state projection, rebuild, grounding, quarantine, reset — is
//! **provided by this trait**, so an engine implements the primitives and
//! inherits the semantics. That layering is the contract a parity
//! implementation follows in another language: the Go/bbolt engine
//! implements these same primitives over the same key encodings
//! (`rrd-core/fixtures/golden-vectors.json` is the cross-language proof)
//! and the semantic layer above it is a translation, not a redesign.
//!
//! Three engines ship in Rust today: [`Store`] (the transitional Fjall
//! compatibility adapter), [`crate::NativeEngine`] (the Rrd-native target),
//! and [`MemoryEngine`] (the reference, for conformance differentials per
//! standing rule 3). Cache tiers (Moka in-process, Dragonfly shared)
//! compose *around* an engine rather than implementing this trait: they
//! accelerate reads and must never be the system of record.
