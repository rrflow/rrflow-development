# RRFlow vector quantization lifecycle

**Status:** active implementation reference; native delta input and outward conformance remain incomplete
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/reference/vector/quantization-lifecycle`
**Owner:** immutable quantized artifact build, activation, retirement, and exact-rerank semantics

RRFlow treats quantization as a rebuildable projection of canonical dense
vectors. Scalar, product, binary, and TurboQuant artifacts use one
engine-authorized lifecycle and the [shared vector planner](search.md). Their
scores can select candidate references; canonical full-precision vectors and
the exact scorer remain authoritative for returned hits.

## Canonical lifecycle

Provider-neutral contract types and `RrdEngine` methods implement four
operations:

- build the next immutable generation in `ready` state;
- list bounded artifact and lifecycle evidence;
- activate one verified generation for planning; and
- retire a generation without changing canonical vector history.

An immutable artifact entry binds collection, named vector, codec kind,
projection descriptor, generation, source cursor, configuration and artifact
digests, content-addressed object receipt, and build time. Append-only
build/activate/retire events use contiguous revisions and a predecessor-digest
chain. Reconstruction rejects missing or duplicate builds, revision gaps,
digest-chain changes, non-contiguous generations, backward activation, and
non-atomic record/object publication.

`ready` artifacts are not served. Activation verifies object length and digest,
binary framing, descriptor identity, codec, and internal checksum. Activating
a later generation retires the prior active generation for the same identity.
Restart reconstructs active generations through the same planner; missing or
corrupt bytes fail closed.

The generic HNSW/exact artifact catalogue and the quantization lifecycle have
separate revision coordinates because they govern different artifact families.
They meet only in the engine-owned planner and cannot publish canonical point
state.

## Codecs and query semantics

The implemented codec families are:

| Method | Packed-vector ratio | Representation |
|---|---:|---|
| Scalar | 4x | artifact-wide symmetric signed int8 scale and dense codes |
| Product | 4x, 8x, 16x, 32x, or 64x | deterministic 256-entry subspace codebooks and centroid codes |
| Binary | 32x | sign-bit vectors with full-precision query scoring |
| TurboQuant | 8x, 16x, 21x, or 32x | seeded Hadamard rotation, fixed low-bit codes, and norm correction |

These ratios compare full-precision vector bytes to packed vector bytes, not
complete artifact size or resident memory. Metadata and product codebooks are
accounted separately, and small product-quantized corpora may produce a larger
complete artifact than their f32 payload.

All four families have bounded checksummed binary formats and read-only mmap
reopen. Scalar, product, and TurboQuant scoring use runtime-dispatched AVX2 on
supported x86_64 systems with a scalar oracle; binary uses packed-bit
operations. The planner rechecks scope, field, dimensions, metric, model,
filter coverage, source cursor, valid time, read cursor, generation, and
artifact identity. Approximate scores select references, then exact-f32
reranking produces final results.

## Current persistence boundary

Artifact records, object references, and lifecycle events persist through the
same `RrdEngine`/rrflowKV authority, and the engine integration test proves
ready isolation, activation, search, close/reopen, retirement, update, rebuild,
and reactivation. However, each build currently scans retained runtime changes
from cursor zero and reconstructs all collection candidates before encoding a
new full artifact. There is no native changed-vector input or incremental
quantized-segment maintenance yet.

The code also still exposes TurboQuant through the older
`ensure_vector_index` request as an adapter into the canonical lifecycle. That
adapter is pre-release convergence debt, not a compatibility promise. C-05 and
J-01 must remove the alternate request path so build/activate/retire is the
only quantization lifecycle in the 1.0 executable.

## Evidence and remaining gates

The fixed 512-vector by 64-dimension matrix covers eleven codec/ratio rows,
eight queries, exact reranking over 96 candidates, mmap descriptor identity,
corruption denial, scalar/SIMD parity, byte accounting, mean absolute score
error no greater than 0.15, and mean Recall@10 of at least 0.80. The retained
debug-host observation is
[`docs/evidence/g04-w04-quantization-local-512x64.json`](../../evidence/g04-w04-quantization-local-512x64.json);
it is not a release SLO or Qdrant-equivalence claim.

Gate C-04 must provide bounded direct canonical vector/delta reads. Gate E-04
must make index deltas atomic with point commits and prove rebuild/reopen under
failure. Gate F-03 must execute quantized candidate generation and exact
reranking inside the stamped Arrow operator pipeline. H-04 must prove every
public adapter lowers to the same engine operations. Until then, the lifecycle
and codecs are real, but the optimized persistent recall path is incomplete.
