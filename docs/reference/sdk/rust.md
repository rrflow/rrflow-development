# RRFlow Rust SDK

**Status:** active implementation reference; alpha SDK qualification is incomplete
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/reference/sdk/rust`
**Owner:** Rust client construction, typed operation binding, transport, retry, cancellation, subscription, error, secret, and conformance behavior

`rrd-client` is the supported asynchronous Rust client foundation for public
RRD operations. Its only normal RRFlow dependency is `rrd-contract`; engine,
storage, query, vector, security, estate, and server crates are confined to
development fixtures. That dependency direction is correct and must remain.

This record does not make the client another engine. Authentication,
authorization, read-stamp selection, physical planning, rrflowMX/rrflowKV
access, rrflowQL, Arrow/DataFusion execution, graph/BM25/vector work, reasoning
mutation, installation, and attunement remain behind `RrdEngine`. The client
constructs and carries typed public operations and verifies their public
results. The [public contract](../protocol/public-contract.md) owns the wire
vocabulary, the [server reference](../protocol/server.md) owns the daemon
adapter, the [engine data flow](../../architecture/engine-data-flow.md) owns the
underlying execution, and the [roadmap](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md) owns
acceptance.

## Required end-to-end boundary

```text
Rust application
  -> rrd-client typed operation + explicit endpoint/security profile
  -> HTTP or multiplexed WebSocket RRD transport
  -> RrdEngine authentication, authorization, stamp, planning, and transaction
  -> rrflowMX or rrflowKV + native graph/BM25/vector + rrflowQL/DataFusion
  -> one validated result/denial/receipt with the same IDs, stamp, and trace
```

The SDK cannot select a storage profile, raw key, physical index, DataFusion
plan, model backend, or project database. It may express semantic intent and
budgets exposed by `rrd-contract`. Cross-surface proof must compare the result,
denial, stamp, digest, receipt, and causal identity produced by the engine—not
merely compare JSON shapes.

## Audited current surface

The executable `endpoint_catalogue()` contains 33 HTTP operations and one
generic authenticated `/v1/ws` descriptor. `RrdClient` currently supplies
typed HTTP methods for 28 of those 33 operations, while `RrdWebSocket`
implements the bounded B-04 multiplexed protocol. The current boundary is:

| Family | Catalogued HTTP operations | Rust methods now | Missing now |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| Service health | 2 | 0 | `health-live`, `health-ready` |
| Capability and schema discovery | 3 | 3 | none |
| Sessions | 3 | 3 | none |
| Transactions | 4 | 4 | none |
| rrflowQL query | 1 | 1 | none |
| Query indexes and live polling | 3 | 0 | `query-index-ensure`, `query-index-list`, `query-live-poll` |
| Vector collections, points, and search | 5 | 5 | none |
| Changefeeds | 2 | 2 | none |
| Durable-subscription administration | 2 | 2 | none |
| Backup and restore | 3 | 3 | none |
| Estate | 1 | 1 | none |
| Audit | 2 | 2 | none |
| Diagnostics | 1 | 1 | none |
| Context | 1 | 1 | none |
| **Total** | **33** | **28** | **5** |

The WebSocket method authenticates one generic connection, validates the
server's opening identity and negotiated limits, and carries request,
cancellation, multiple subscription, delivery, cumulative ACK, heartbeat,
unsubscribe, error, and backpressure frames. It tracks exact in-flight
coordinates and durable resume state without owning engine lifecycle. Generic
requests remain deliberately fail-closed at the server until H-04 binds the
shared operation dispatcher.

## Behavior worth retaining

The complete source and real-server fixtures establish useful foundations:

- local cleartext construction is restricted to an explicit loopback socket;
- network construction requires an HTTPS origin and an explicit Rustls client
  configuration;
- capability discovery checks protocol and expected RRD instance identity;
- common request, resource, correlation, deadline, and mutation-idempotency
  coordinates are typed;
- the client-owned `Session` handle keeps its bearer-bearing lease private,
  exposes only non-secret metadata, and uses a tested redacted `Debug`
  implementation;
- HTTP response accumulation is capped at four MiB;
- API error bodies preserve their current closed error code, message,
  retryability value, and HTTP status;
- loopback tests exercise a real secured server, independent generic-connect
  and subscription permissions, correlated request/cancellation results, two
  multiplexed durable streams, and reconnect/ACK behavior rather than a
  mocked client;
- malicious-server tests reject foreign connection IDs, sequence gaps,
  unknown payload fields, binary application messages, oversized messages,
  and mismatched response IDs; and
- a separate HTTPS/WSS fixture proves a configured mutual-TLS success path,
  missing-client-certificate denial, and wrong-server-name denial.

Those facts characterize the present client. They do not prove complete
operation coverage, full request/response validation, stable retry semantics,
H-04 operation execution/cancellation, endpoint rotation, installed
deployment, or cross-language equivalence.

## Catalogue-driven operation binding

The operation catalogue is the sole executable registry. A Rust method must
bind its operation identifier to the catalogue descriptor and derive or verify
the exact method, route template, authentication kind, mutation flag, security
action, request type, response type, response media type, and successful HTTP
status. The current descriptor must be extended to own the latter two facts;
no separately maintained client route table or documentation list may silently
drift.

Every catalogued operation must have exactly one Rust binding. The coverage
test must fail on a missing or extra binding. Dynamic path values are encoded
only through the descriptor's typed path parameters; string formatting cannot
create an uncatalogued endpoint.

Before network I/O, the binding must validate both the common envelope and the
operation payload. After I/O, it must enforce the declared media type and byte
limit, decode once, validate the complete `ResponseEnvelope` and operation
payload, match the exact expected status/outcome, and match protocol, instance,
request, operation, resource, stamp, and receipt coordinates applicable to the
operation. A generic `2xx` check or deserialization without the type's semantic
validation is insufficient.

The current client validates the common request envelope but does not invoke
each operation payload's validator. It decodes response envelopes without
calling their complete validator, validates only selected success payloads,
does not check response `Content-Type`, discards the observed successful status
before the typed outcome helper, and supplies `200 OK` there. Consequently an
unexpected successful `2xx`, invalid bounded error body, or semantically
invalid typed success can pass farther than the public contract intends.

## Bootstrap and endpoint resolution

A client connection begins with transport reachability, not database
initialization:

1. resolve an explicitly configured loopback or network endpoint candidate and
   its expected RRD instance/security identity;
2. establish the configured transport and authenticate the TLS server where
   applicable;
3. call liveness, then readiness;
4. negotiate protocol and exact instance identity through capabilities;
5. load the operation catalogue, and optionally its OpenAPI projection, at the
   advertised digest; and
6. create an authenticated application session before protected work.

The client never creates an instance because a path or endpoint is absent and
never treats a TCP connection, mesh membership, liveness, or TLS alone as RRD
readiness. The H-07 resolver accepts loopback or an installed mesh adapter as
address discovery only. It returns bounded candidate addresses plus expected
transport and RRD identities; endpoint rotation repeats authenticated
negotiation. Zuul Zero/shippin.ai reachability never grants RRFlow permission
and never owns RRFlow state.

## Retry, deadline, and outcome certainty

Retry is an operation-semantic decision, not a boolean transport convenience.
The canonical policy is explicit, bounded by an overall deadline and attempt
count, and records attempt/decision evidence without secrets. Backoff and
jitter are bounded configuration, not hidden global policy.

| Operation condition | Automatic replay rule |
|---|---|
| Public safe discovery request | May retry a classified transient transport failure within the declared budget. |
| Session-bound read pinned to one accepted read coordinate or durable result binding | May retry only while the server can preserve the same semantic observation. |
| Unpinned read whose first response was lost | Must not silently return a later observation as though it were the first; return a typed uncertain observation or require an explicit caller policy. |
| Mutation with an engine-durable exact request/operation/idempotency binding | May retry the identical bytes and coordinates; the server's recorded receipt is authoritative. |
| Mutation without that durable binding, changed bytes, expired binding, or unknown commit disposition | Must not replay automatically; return a typed uncertain outcome requiring receipt/status reconciliation. |
| Typed API denial or invalid protocol/result | Never becomes a transport retry merely because an error says it is retryable. Any future server retry hint must be authenticated, catalogued, and bounded. |

The current implementation does not satisfy that matrix. Public discovery and
idempotency-bound mutations can retry up to the configured 1–8 attempts, with
no backoff or jitter. Ordinary session reads execute once, contrary to the
removed flat record's statement that reads retry. `request_timeout` applies to
each attempt while an optional absolute deadline bounds the remaining time.

Dropping a Tokio future or reaching the local timeout ends local waiting; it
does not prove that the server stopped compute or a mutation did not commit.
B-04 now provides the correlated cancellation request and terminal outcome
shape. The current server returns `not_found` because H-04 has not bound
generic operations to cancellable engine work. Mutation certainty remains
governed by the durable engine receipt even when the caller disconnects.

## Authentication, secrets, and transport identity

The client authenticates three distinct facts and must not collapse them:

- endpoint resolution identifies where to connect;
- TLS validates the configured server name/trust and, for mutual TLS, presents
  the configured client identity; and
- RRD capabilities plus application authentication validate the exact instance
  and authorize the principal/session operation.

The normal constructor consumes an installed or explicitly supplied
authenticated transport profile. Any test-only verifier override remains
visibly unsafe and cannot be accepted by the default constructor or qualify a
deployment.

API keys, bearer tokens, private keys, session identifiers, and other
credential material must not appear in `Debug`, `Display`, errors, traces,
metrics, URLs, process arguments, or response excerpts. A-07.1b directly
removed the public bearer-bearing `SessionLease` field from `Session`.
`Session` now exposes only principal, session identity, lease times, and
limits; its manual `Debug` prints a redaction marker and a focused test proves
the token bytes are absent. The bearer is still an ordinary `CorrelationId`
inside the private handle and is formatted into an authorization header, so
H-04 still owns a deliberately limited secret wrapper, copy/zeroization policy,
and adversarial diagnostic/error proof. Transport errors must retain typed
sources and classifications without including authorization headers or
uncontrolled server bodies.

## WebSocket bounds and frame integrity

`ClientConfig` now requires validated `WebSocketLimits`. The client passes
message, frame, read-buffer, write-buffer, and maximum-write-buffer bounds to
`tokio-tungstenite` before connecting, then admits only a server `connected`
frame whose negotiated limits are no greater than the local profile. The
default maximum frame and reassembled application message are one MiB;
in-flight requests and attached subscriptions are bounded and checked before
send.

The direction-specific codec rejects a wrong protocol/version, foreign
connection, repeated or missing first `connected` frame, non-contiguous
sequence, client-only server payload, binary application data, unknown JSON
fields, excessive JSON depth/items, unbounded errors/reasons, and responses
without exact pending coordinates. Subscription delivery must match the
active identity, generation, contiguous delivery sequence, and cursor. ACK,
unsubscribe, heartbeat, error, and backpressure targets are checked against
exact pending or active state. `receive_until` exposes an absolute receive
deadline, and all sends use the negotiated timeout.

This proves B-04 carriage and protocol integrity for the Rust reference
client. It does not prove H-04 generic operation execution, server-side
cancellation of active compute, operation-semantic retry certainty, or
generated-language parity.

## Errors and causal evidence

The final error surface is closed and phase-aware: local contract, endpoint
resolution, TLS identity, transport, timeout/cancel, protocol, API denial,
response validation, resource exhaustion, and uncertain observation or
mutation outcome remain distinguishable. It retains safe underlying causes
for diagnostics, exposes retry classification derived from operation semantics,
and never turns strings into authorization or completion truth.

Every request carries the canonical request and operation IDs plus W3C
`traceparent`/`tracestate` when valid. Client attempts are child spans of the
same operation and transport reconnects are causal links, not new semantic
operations. Tracing never contains credentials or hidden model reasoning and
never substitutes for the authoritative response, job, transaction, or
subscription record.

## Conformance that actually counts

`fixtures/rrd-sdk-conformance-v1.json` is a shared input, not proof by its
existence or by a list of domain labels. Each scenario must declare its exact
preconditions, operation(s), assertions, faults, and expected engine evidence.
The current corpus overstates several rows:

| Current label | Scenario actually executed | Required closure |
|---|---|---|
| `crud` | one document create and read | create, read, update, retire/delete, conflict, and reopen semantics |
| `backup` | create and list | restore, interrupted restore, identity, and reopen |
| `vectors` | ensure and search | list, scroll, retrieve, update/delete, filters, exact comparison, and reopen |
| `live_feeds` | HTTP changefeed read/follow; separate B-04 Rust tests now prove multiplexed delivery, ACK, detach, and reconnect replay | H-03 commit-impact deltas and the same structural scenario in every surface |
| `typed_errors` | one unauthenticated denial | the closed error/denial matrix with bounded details and redaction |
| `retries` | one connection dropped before a capability request | before-send, after-send, after-commit, lost-response, bounded replay, and uncertain-outcome cases |
| `cancellation` | caller wraps one follow future in a local timeout; separate B-04 Rust proof covers a correlated fail-closed request and terminal `not_found` cancellation | H-04 cancellation of actual shared-dispatch work, including disconnect and commit races |
| `versions` | one incompatible capability response | protocol, catalogue/schema digest, package, and supported-release matrix |

The harness now materializes one checked inert distribution-anchor fixture,
canonically plans/applies an empty temporary project, requires the derived
instance and estate IDs to equal the checked corpus, and opens the installed
engine. It extends that fixture's schema and security state without replacing
the installed identity, then starts one real daemon for Rust, TypeScript,
Python, Go, Java, and .NET. This proves that all six checked SDKs execute the
present shared rrflowKV corpus against one canonically installed identity; it
does not qualify distribution acquisition, public schema/security setup,
rrflowMX parity, release operation coverage, or the product lifecycle. The
release corpus must use only public operations, run the same semantic cases
against rrflowMX and rrflowKV where applicable, add rrflowKV crash/reopen cases,
and compare loopback, authenticated network, HTTP, multiplexed WebSocket, Rust,
generated languages, CLI, MCP, GraphQL, and Connectome at one expected engine
result.

The Rust conformance test must never report a successful scenario when
`RRD_SDK_CONFORMANCE_MANIFEST` is absent. It must either be an explicitly
ignored integration target or fail closed. The runner verifies scenario
coverage structurally rather than comparing a set of self-declared domain
names.

## Evidence observed in this review

| Command or inspection | Result | Honest boundary |
|---|---|---|
| A-07.1b public-method inventory comparison | Every pre-split public method remains; only non-secret session metadata accessors were added. | Source/API-shape preservation except the intentional removal of public credential fields; not operation conformance. |
| `session_debug_redacts_the_bearer_credential` | 1 passed | Proves the client-owned session formatter omits the synthetic bearer; not memory zeroization or all-error redaction. |
| `cargo test -p rrd-client --test real_server --locked` | 3 passed | Real loopback, generic WSS, independent attach permission, two-stream multiplexing, exact replay/ACK, and narrow deployment behavior; not H-04 operation execution, storage-profile, or release conformance. |
| `cargo test -p rrd-client --test transport_faults --locked` | 3 tests covering 6 malicious-server scenarios passed | B-04 connection, sequence, shape, binary, size, and response-correlation rejection; not every transport/TLS/failure race. |
| Rust conformance test with no manifest | Cargo reported 1 passed in 0.00 s | The test returned before executing a scenario; this is not conformance evidence. |
| `python3 scripts/ci/run_sdk_conformance.py` | Rust, TypeScript, Python, Go, Java, and .NET passed one real installed daemon; corpus SHA-256 was `0f6ba4c172d58a64c69757c26bf502e93ed8b9cbe8394d84aaad1defe80fd09e`. | Canonical installed identity and six-language execution of the present limited rrflowKV corpus; not public setup, rrflowMX parity, full labelled behavior, or release proof. |
| Generated-surface parity check | 33 HTTP operations matched OpenAPI | Checks generated TypeScript/Python/Go/Java/.NET endpoint maps; it does not inspect Rust method coverage. |
| Normal dependency inspection | no RRFlow implementation crate below `rrd-client` | Correct client dependency direction; dev-only server/engine/store dependencies remain test fixtures. |

No row proves the persistent multi-model reasoning/recall engine. That proof is
owned by C through H and then exercised through the SDK in H-04/J.

## Direct-convergence source boundary

A-07.1b directly split the former 1,235-line implementation monolith along
already accepted responsibilities. `lib.rs` is now only the crate contract,
module declarations, and public exports; there is no forwarding monolith:

```text
crates/transport/rrd-client/src/
├── lib.rs             # narrow public exports
├── client.rs          # client identity plus capability/schema discovery
├── endpoint.rs        # explicit loopback or mutual-TLS construction
├── error.rs           # current closed client error vocabulary
├── operation.rs       # current typed calls, envelopes, and outcome checks
├── retry.rs           # current attempt/deadline configuration
├── session.rs         # private credential-bearing session handle
├── subscription.rs    # bounded generic multiplexed WebSocket client
└── transport.rs       # current bounded HTTP carriage

crates/transport/rrd-client/tests/
├── operation_coverage.rs      # planned H-04
├── protocol_validation.rs     # planned H-04/J-02
├── transport_faults.rs        # B-04 faults; extended by H-04/H-07/J-02
├── real_server.rs
└── sdk_conformance.rs
```

The gates then close behavior in dependency order:

1. **A-07.1b/A-07 (implemented):** characterized behavior,
   direct modules, public names, the redacted session boundary, and the exact
   current symbol/test map are preserved with no compatibility module or old
   implementation body.
2. **B-04 (implemented):** the dedicated socket is absent; one bounded
   multiplexed protocol and Rust carriage now own request/cancel/subscription
   correlation, exact resume state, and adversarial frame rejection.
3. **H-04:** bind all 33 operations from the catalogue, validate every request
   and response, and compare Rust with every supported surface against one
   real `RrdEngine` corpus.
4. **H-07:** add endpoint resolution/rotation as an outward adapter while
   keeping TLS, RRD instance identity, and authorization independent.
5. **J-02/J-03/J-05:** pass the failure, resource, clean-install, offline
   distribution, package, and release matrix with retained raw evidence.

## Primary constraints

- [RFC 9110, HTTP method idempotency](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-idempotent-methods)
  bounds automatic replay by operation semantics; RRFlow's body-level
  idempotency binding remains its own stronger application contract.
- [Tokio timeout](https://docs.rs/tokio/1.53.1/tokio/time/fn.timeout.html)
  defines local cancellation by dropping the future; it is not server
  completion evidence.
- [Rustls `ClientConfig`](https://docs.rs/rustls/0.23.43/rustls/client/struct.ClientConfig.html)
  owns TLS server verification and client-credential selection, distinct from
  RRD authorization.
- [W3C Trace Context](https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/) defines interoperable
  `traceparent` and `tracestate` propagation; RRFlow still owns its bounded
  causal attributes and redaction.
- [OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Logging_Cheat_Sheet.html#data-to-exclude)
  identifies access tokens, authentication secrets, and session identifiers as
  data that should not be recorded directly.
- The locked `tungstenite` 0.29.0 `WebSocketConfig` source defines the carriage
  controls used by the client; RRFlow supplies validated explicit limits and
  proves them with adversarial tests rather than inheriting library defaults.
