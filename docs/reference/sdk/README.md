# RRFlow SDK reference

**Status:** active SDK-reference index
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/reference-index/sdk`
**Owner:** supported language-client behavior and conformance discovery; linked from `docs/reference/README.md`

SDKs are outward clients of the public RRD protocol. They may provide typed
construction, transport, authentication, cancellation, retry, subscription,
and result APIs, but they do not own engine semantics or open rrflowMX,
rrflowKV, rrflowQL, DataFusion, graph, index, vector, reasoning, attunement, or
automation state directly.

The executable public contract and operation/capability catalogues are the one
language-neutral source. OpenAPI, internal client bindings, language operations
and models, reference coverage, and the shared conformance matrix are generated
projections. A language record documents only runtime, packaging, toolchain,
and qualification differences. A generated schema or compiling package is not
a supported SDK until its installed real-process conformance passes. See the
[generation design](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0-execution/generated-surfaces.md).

Other language records enter this index only after their contract-derived
implementation, shared corpus behavior, and toolchain execution have been
reviewed. The [public-contract reference](../protocol/public-contract.md) owns
the language-neutral operation and wire authority; the
[release roadmap](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md) alone owns completion.
