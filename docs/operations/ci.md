# RRFlow CI and runner operations

**Status:** active operational contract; current checks are not RRFlow alpha or release evidence
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/operations/ci`
**Owner:** candidate CI topology, workflow supply-chain policy, diagnostic workflow boundary, and private runner procedure; indexed by `docs/operations/README.md`

This record describes checked-in automation and the operator steps around it.
The [release roadmap](../roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md) alone owns gate status, the
[repository run checklist](../roadmap/rrflow-1.0-execution-map.md#repository-wide-run-checklist)
defines risk-based package widening, and the [POA&M](../poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha.md)
owns deficiencies. A green workflow proves only the commands and assertions it
actually executes.

## Candidate chain

RRFlow has one candidate CI chain. The thin caller is
`.github/workflows/ci.yml`; `.github/workflows/ci-reusable.yml` owns every
check. A branch push does not start a second copy of the same work.

The caller accepts pull requests, merge-queue candidates, and explicit manual
dispatches. Its concurrency key cancels stale executions for the same pull
request or ref. The reusable workflow reduces every partition into one stable
`ci-gate` check for branch protection:

- supervised RRD daemon smoke on the standard Linux runner;
- repository policy, formatting, architecture, evaluation, dependency, and
  binary-budget gates on a heavy Linux runner;
- five default-feature engine suites on isolated heavy Linux runners:
  `kernel-storage`, `query-retrieval`, `engine-authority`, `service-protocol`,
  and `product-operations`;
- one current shared SDK harness, isolated optional-feature checks, and a real
  PostgreSQL/pgvector integration;
- daemon portability on GitHub-hosted Windows and macOS runners; and
- one always-evaluated gate which fails unless every partition succeeded.

The topology job starts one local RRD daemon and checks readiness and
capabilities. It does not start Connectome or prove installation, rrflowMX and
rrflowKV semantic equivalence, native graph/BM25/vector projections, streamed
Arrow/DataFusion execution, persistent reasoning/context, or restart recovery.
The shared SDK harness is also current characterization: the deficiencies and
real-process corpus required for H-04 remain open. Neither job may be cited as
complete-engine evidence.

The repository-policy partition also verifies the generated
`docs/roadmap/rrflow-1.0-file-plan.jsonl`. That inventory must match every
tracked or non-ignored path and every long-lived future path registered by its
generator. Immediate absent paths are authorized by the earlier active change
package and become current inventory records when created. Regenerate the
inventory with `python3 scripts/ci/build_execution_inventory.py` after an
accepted path or content change.

Marked documentation indexes are derived from their immediate coordinated
children. Run `python3 scripts/knowledge/render_navigation.py` after adding,
moving, or removing a child record; `--check` is non-mutating and fails on
drift. The same tool derives the coordinate/link relationship graph used for
future knowledge import and retrieval. Generated listings and edges are
navigation, not documentation or lifecycle authority.

The same partition enforces the documentation bootstrap package. The
documentation policy builds and validates two in-memory packages through the
single exporter, while the workflow exports twice at the checked-out revision,
compares the exact JSONL bytes, and runs the focused drift corpus. Package
outputs remain temporary and are never editable documentation authority.

The five engine suites cover every workspace package exactly once, but package
names do not define product ownership. The partitioning avoids one
workspace-wide test/link target graph on the hosted fallback without turning
all 20 implementation packages into separate product checks.

## Presubmit and change-evidence boundary

Repository presubmit is not an RRFlow runtime hook. It cannot create an engine
event, trigger a persisted routine, resolve a skill, mutate an estate, or claim
that an effect completed. Gate I owns those future runtime capabilities.

The portable development control has three layers:

1. the checked-in commands and policy scripts are the reproducible presubmit;
2. candidate CI runs those exact controls and reduces them to
   `pipeline / ci-gate`; and
3. repository branch policy makes the pull request and stable check
   non-bypassable when the GitHub account tier supports that control.

Every code-bearing or structural package first commits
`docs/roadmap/rrflow-1.0-active-change.json` in a planning-only commit. The
record binds one immutable parent revision and tree, complete baseline-file
digests and line intervals, exact changed paths and symbols, research and
adaptation decisions, failure oracles, acceptance commands,
trace/resource/debug decisions, and stop conditions. The subsequent package
may change only its declared implementation and evidence paths; changing the
plan itself requires stopping and making another planning-only commit.

This machine record begins at the repository-effect boundary. It is not a
workflow for exploratory reading or private AI reasoning and must not contain
hidden chain-of-thought. Repository tooling should derive baseline, digest,
line-count, generated-link, and final-diff facts; authors supply the semantic
intent, risk, evidence, and stop decisions.

Run `python3 scripts/ci/check_change_plan.py` as the local presubmit. It
authenticates the planning commit and every complete-file review against Git,
then reconciles paths touched by every post-plan commit—including paths later
reverted—with the staged, unstaged, and non-ignored untracked worktree. It
rejects mixed plan/code commits, stale baselines, partial reviews, undeclared
or omitted paths, a changed lockfile, and missing research, failure,
acceptance, observability, or stop evidence. The generated file inventory is a
complete tree ledger, but it is not permission to edit; the earlier committed
active package is the authorization envelope.

Candidate CI checks out complete Git history and runs the same command before
format, build, or test work. The checker proves plan-to-diff conformance, not
algorithm correctness or alpha readiness, and it remains locally bypassable
by a person controlling the checkout. Only the separately evidenced
server-side protection below can make the required candidate check and review
non-bypassable.

A developer may run the
[repository checklist](../roadmap/rrflow-1.0-execution-map.md#repository-wide-run-checklist)
locally before publishing, but the local run is convenience and early feedback,
not authority. RRFlow deliberately has no installed Git/editor/provider hook:
client Git hooks are not distributed by clone, can be skipped, and would create
the exact provider-owned lifecycle behavior prohibited by `AGENTS.md`.

The documentation policy machine-checks the owner chain, required
change-authoring procedure/evidence fields, generated-index freshness,
active-record classification, knowledge-package determinism, and local links.
The execution inventory checks every current/generated/registered-planned
path. The change-plan validator proves that the candidate checkout's complete
post-plan path set is covered by one earlier machine-readable package. Each
package records its result in a linked record under
`docs/evidence/change-journals/`; the execution portal contains no journal
bodies. These checked-in controls remain bypassable outside candidate CI;
POAM-027 stays open for eligible server-side review/check/force-push/deletion
enforcement.

## Repository workflow policy

`scripts/ci/check_workflow.py` discovers every checked-in `.yml` and `.yaml`
under `.github/workflows/`; a newly added workflow cannot escape its
supply-chain checks. It requires:

- every external action to use a full 40-character commit SHA;
- every workflow service image to use a SHA-256 digest;
- every checkout step to set `persist-credentials: false`;
- top-level read-only contents permission and no `pull_request_target` in any
  workflow; and
- complete candidate-suite/default-feature/optional-feature coverage, bounded
  candidate jobs, safe fork routing, and exact final-gate reduction.

Workflow ownership is directory-wide in `.github/CODEOWNERS`, so adding a new
workflow does not bypass the existing workflow review boundary. Repository or
organization settings should additionally require full-SHA actions; that
external GitHub setting cannot be proven by this checkout.

## Scheduled storage diagnostics

`.github/workflows/rrd-lsm-benchmark.yml` is separate from candidate CI. It
runs manually and weekly on `ubuntu-latest`, uses the same immutable checkout,
toolchain, and cache action revisions, and uploads raw semantic-storage and
AI-access results with a pinned artifact action. It is intentionally not a
required `ci-gate` dependency.

The [rrflowKV benchmark reference](../reference/storage/rrflowkv-benchmark-harness.md)
owns those executable shapes and their limitations. Hosted runner output lacks
the fixed hardware, complete provenance, full governed engine flow, and
quality/failure corpus required by J-04; scheduling and artifact upload cannot
turn it into performance or competitive evidence.

## Diagnostic, performance, and fault lanes

The
[engine observability contract](../architecture/engine-data-flow.md#runtime-modes-build-profiles-and-build-identity)
defines one semantic engine with release, optimized-diagnostic,
runtime-analysis, sanitizer, and benchmark modes. None of those modes is
currently a qualified RRFlow binary merely because Cargo can compile the
workspace.

Candidate CI stays bounded to deterministic correctness and repository policy.
Additional lanes enter the required gate only with an owning roadmap package,
declared target/support matrix, time/resource budget, retained failure
artifacts, and a false-negative analysis:

| Lane | Required use | Gate/evidence boundary |
|---|---|---|
| optimized diagnostic parity | Prove release and diagnostic profiles have identical feature closure, formats, operations, results, receipts, and resource limits; symbols/configuration may differ. | H-05, J-03, J-05 |
| deterministic fault/reopen | Inject WAL/manifest/segment/page, sync, acknowledgement, process-kill, ENOSPC, and corruption boundaries; verify exact state after reopen from a recorded seed/schedule. | C-07, D-11, J-02 |
| Loom | Explore bounded concurrent schedules around transaction, cache, publication, and cancellation primitives. | owning C-through-I package, J-02 |
| Miri/sanitizers | Detect supported undefined-behavior, address/leak, and race classes on deliberately bounded targets. | owning package, J-02 |
| Tokio Console/profiler | Diagnose scheduler, resource, lock, allocation, CPU, and I/O stalls only after ordinary correlated evidence identifies a reproducible case. | runtime-analysis; never conformance by itself |
| fixed-hardware benchmark | Retain raw histograms, failed samples, quality/correctness results, resource use, build identity, workload, and machine/filesystem/device provenance. | J-04 only |

Hosted runner benchmarks and ad hoc `cargo bench` output remain diagnostics.
They cannot support a latency, scalability, zero-copy, resource, or competitor
claim. The J-04 harness must use the canonical latency boundary and diagnostic
capture bundle, separate success/error and cold/warm behavior, and preserve
p50/p95/p99/p99.9 distributions rather than averages.

## Runner trust boundary

The repository variables below contain JSON `runs-on` values:

| Variable | Physical pool value | Safe default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `CI_SELF_HOSTED_ENABLED` | `true` | disabled |
| `CI_LINUX_STANDARD_RUNNER` | `["rrflow-standard"]` | `["ubuntu-latest"]` |
| `CI_LINUX_HEAVY_RUNNER` | `["rrflow-heavy"]` | `["ubuntu-latest"]` |

A pull request whose head repository differs from the base repository is
forced onto GitHub-hosted Linux even when the variables exist. Missing or
disabled `CI_SELF_HOSTED_ENABLED` also forces hosted Linux. The workflow does
not use `pull_request_target`. Same-repository branches, merge groups, and
manual proofs may use the private physical pool.

This routing expression is defense in depth, not permission to connect a
self-hosted pool to a public repository: a fork can propose a change to the
workflow itself. The installer queries GitHub and fails closed unless the
repository visibility is `PRIVATE`. Do not set the physical routing variables
or register the scale sets while the repository is public.

GitHub recommends ephemeral runners for autoscaling and identifies Actions
Runner Controller (ARC) as its reference Kubernetes implementation. The
checked-in deployment is configured as follows:

- ARC chart version: `0.14.2`; controller, runner, and Docker images are
  digest pinned;
- `rrflow-heavy`: scale 0..1, 48 CPUs and 64 GiB total, isolated Docker daemon;
- `rrflow-standard`: scale 0..2, 16 CPUs and 20 GiB each; and
- maximum runner allocation: 80 CPUs and 104 GiB, leaving 8 CPUs and 24 GiB
  for the 88-CPU/128-GiB host, k3s, ARC, and filesystem cache.

Each job receives a fresh pod and an empty work volume. No runner worktree is
mounted from the host. The runner service account has no Kubernetes API
permissions, and only the heavy class has a privileged Docker sidecar.

## Physical-host bootstrap

Install a pinned single-node k3s `v1.36.3+k3s1` cluster on the physical host
and make its kubeconfig available to the administration machine. Do not share
this cluster with production workloads. Install Helm 4 and authenticate `gh`
as a repository administrator. The checked-in script does not install or
attest those prerequisites. Run it from the target checkout with an explicit
repository identity, or let `gh repo view` resolve the current checkout:

```bash
GITHUB_REPOSITORY=OWNER/REPOSITORY \
  KUBECONFIG=/path/to/physical-host.kubeconfig \
  scripts/ci/install-arc.sh
```

The installer validates an `OWNER/REPOSITORY` coordinate and denies
public-repository registration before creating separate controller and runner
namespaces. It streams the existing GitHub token directly into a Kubernetes
Secret, installs the version-selected OCI charts with digest-pinned images,
waits for the controller, installs both scale sets, and sets the repository
routing variables. It does not write the token to argv or a values file.

The chart fetch, GitHub API calls, and Kubernetes operations require network
and administrator access. This is CI-infrastructure bootstrap, not the RRFlow
offline distribution or per-project installation path, and no checked-in
record currently proves that the physical pool is installed.

Prove physical execution after installation:

```bash
gh workflow run ci.yml --repo OWNER/REPOSITORY \
  --ref <candidate-branch>
gh run watch --repo OWNER/REPOSITORY --exit-status
```

The standard and heavy jobs must report `rrflow-standard` and `rrflow-heavy`
runner identities. Windows, macOS, the final gate, and all fork pull requests
must remain GitHub-hosted.

## Repository enforcement

After the first physical proof succeeds and the hosting tier exposes the
control, protect `main` with these invariants:

- pull requests and the stable `pipeline / ci-gate` check are required;
- merge queue or an up-to-date branch is required;
- force pushes and deletion are denied; and
- Actions must require immutable full-SHA references.

This is an external control and needs external evidence. On 2026-09-11,
read-only GitHub API requests for both repository rulesets and `main` branch
protection on private `rrflow/rrflow-development` returned HTTP 403 with the
message that GitHub Pro or public visibility is required. Therefore the
checkout does **not** currently claim that `pipeline / ci-gate`, pull requests,
reviews, deletion denial, or force-push denial is enforced. Do not compensate
with a local hook, make the repository public, or push to the official
promotion repository. Enable an eligible private-repository plan or equivalent
organization control, then record the exact repository, rule/protection
identity, required check name, protected ref, API response, and verification
attempt in this record and one linked package journal.

The repository CI-policy check rejects candidate trigger duplication, unsafe
fork routing, unpinned actions, service or runner images, persisted checkout
credentials, over-broad workflow permissions, `pull_request_target`, missing
candidate timeouts, incomplete suite or feature coverage, missing gate
reduction, or a runner layout which exceeds the documented host allocation.
The Rust workspace architecture test remains focused on engine ownership,
dependency direction, and storage-opening authority rather than GitHub Actions
implementation details.
