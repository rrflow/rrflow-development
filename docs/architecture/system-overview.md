# RRFlow system overview

**Status:** active accepted master platform architecture; implementation gaps remain open
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/architecture/system-overview`
**Owner:** canonical platform components, authority boundaries, and high-level relationships
**Decision:** [`../decisions/0001-single-engine-authority.md`](../decisions/0001-single-engine-authority.md)

The repository root [README](../../README.md) is the bootstrap product portal.
This record is the first architecture destination behind that portal. It tells
an operator or AI system what every RRFlow component means and where detailed
architecture lives. The [instance-topology record](instance-topology.md) owns
project, estate, RRD instance, environment, deployment, and physical-placement
relationships. The [engine data-flow record](engine-data-flow.md) owns the
complete read, write, Arrow/DataFusion, and context flows; the
[roadmap](../roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md) owns implementation order and completion.

These are cooperating layers of one system. They are not separately
authoritative databases or engines.

## Canonical component terminology

| Term | Canonical meaning | Implementation boundary |
|---|---|---|
| **RRFlow** | Reason Ready Flow, the complete product and platform. | This repository supplies the engine and bundled adapters; Connectome is a separate public client. |
| **RRD** | Reason Ready Daemon, the embedded/server runtime hosting RRFlow. | `rrd-server` plus embedded `RrdEngine` composition. |
| **`RrdEngine`** | The only semantic coordinator and mutation authority. | `crates/authority/rrd-engine` |
| **RRFlow kernel** | Canonical temporal values, identities, read stamps, mutations, and invariants; it defines meaning without owning transport or physical storage. | `rrd-core` |
| **canonical runtime log** | The ordered source of truth for committed RRFlow changes from which temporal snapshots are resolved. | Semantic types in `rrd-core`, persistence mapping in `rrd-store`, and durable bytes in rrflowKV. |
| **rrflowDB** | One persistent project AI estate containing governed temporal knowledge, reasoning state, evidence, and index definitions. | Semantic state composed by `RrdEngine`; physical durability supplied by rrflowKV. |
| **rrflowKV** | The durable physical engine beneath rrflowDB: WAL, MVCC, LSM, manifests, snapshots, compaction, and recovery. | `rrd-lsm` through `rrd-store` |
| **rrflowMX** | RRFlow Memory Execution, the non-durable process-local implementation of the same semantic storage port. | Volatile implementation in `rrd-store`, behind the semantic storage port. |
| **RRFlow temporal graph** | Typed records and relations resolved from the canonical log at one runtime read stamp and valid-time coordinate; never a separate graph database. | Kernel graph values, persistence adjacency, native query operators, and `RrdEngine` authorization. |
| **RRFlow memory** | Durable temporal claims, records, relations, schemas, vectors, and evidence owned by the same engine; never a separate memory store. | rrflowDB semantic data composed through `RrdEngine`. |
| **rrflowQL** | RRFlow Query Language: syntax, AST, binding, logical and physical planning, and execution. | `rrd-query` |
| **Arrow substrate** | The columnar buffer model for eligible immutable rrflowKV pages and stamped analytical batches. | Apache Arrow types composed by storage and query boundaries. |
| **DataFusion execution** | Bounded vectorized computation over stamped Arrow batches. It cannot authorize or commit state. | DataFusion integration inside `rrd-query` |
| **fast path** | Low-latency point, state, pointer, and bounded graph work that does not invoke DataFusion. | `RrdEngine` over the selected semantic storage profile and native operators. |
| **analytical path** | Broad retrieval, ingest transformation, joins, and analytics planned by rrflowQL over native access paths and stamped Arrow batches. | `rrd-query`, `rrd-vector`, `rrd-store`, and bounded DataFusion execution. |
| **index projection** | Derived acceleration state bound to its source cursor and relevant schema or catalogue revision; it is rebuildable and cannot outrank canonical data. | Scalar, graph, lexical, and approximate-vector structures in persistence and compute boundaries. |
| **context assembly** | Bounded discovery and deterministic fusion owned by `RrdEngine`, returning a read-stamped `ContextPacket` with evidence. | `rrd-contract` operation and `rrd-engine` implementation. |
| **project-tree snapshot** | One deterministic, bounded, committed inventory of observed root-relative project entries, errors, containment, policy, and change evidence; it is the required input to parsing and later attunement phases. | Pure proposal construction in planned `rrd-attunement`; authorized reads and commit coordination in `RrdEngine`. |
| **RRFlow vector subsystem** | Native vector-database capability inside rrflowDB: exact values, payload filters, candidate indexes, and exact reranking. | `rrd-vector`, `rrd-query`, and `RrdEngine` |
| **RRFlow inference** | Provider-neutral, manifest-gated execution of embedding and routing models. | `rrd-inference`; LFG is a constrained routing adapter. |
| **RRFlow seat** | A durable provider-neutral identity represented by one or more authenticated provider identities at a read coordinate; representation establishes attribution, not authorization. Clyffy is this repository's primary seat specialization, not another kernel, repository, runtime, or provider. | Canonical seat/provider/relation values in rrflowDB; resolution, authorization, routing, and mutation through `RrdEngine`. |
| **engine event** | One immutable, identity- and provenance-bound occurrence committed through `RrdEngine`; it is data, not a callback or lifecycle owner. | Canonical event value in the RRFlow kernel, public submission envelope in `rrd-contract`, and semantic persistence through `rrd-store`. |
| **trigger** | A persisted deterministic condition over committed engine events that may propose an authorized operation or routine start but cannot mutate independently. | `RrdEngine` evaluation over rrflowDB state. |
| **routine** | A versioned, durable graph of public `RrdEngine` operations with explicit state, budgets, leases, checkpoints, cancellation, compensation, verification, and terminal outcome. | Definition and run state in rrflowDB; orchestration in `RrdEngine`. |
| **skill** | An immutable, digest-addressed instruction and resource package resolved as governed context; it grants no capability and executes no lifecycle code. | Contract and manifest in `rrd-contract`; content and bindings in rrflowDB; resolution in `RrdEngine`. |
| **host-event adapter** | An optional, explicitly installed stateless translator from a host callback or external signal into the canonical engine-event submission operation. | Outward `rrflow-*` adapter; never an automatic hook or scheduler. |
| **Connectome** | Separate operator and developer workbench using public RRD capabilities. | Separate repository; no embedded engine authority. |

Product documentation uses the exact spellings **RRFlow**, **RRD**,
**`RrdEngine`**, **rrflowDB**, **rrflowKV**, **rrflowMX**, and **rrflowQL**.
Rust package names remain `rrd-*` for internal daemon/runtime boundaries and
`rrflow-*` for outward product adapters.

"Trigger" is reserved for the post-commit engine-event condition above.
Synchronous functions bound to a proposed transaction are transaction function
bindings, not routines or event triggers. "Runtime event" must not survive as
a second event vocabulary when I-01 freezes the canonical engine event.

## Pre-release convergence boundary

RRFlow 1.0 has one current target implementation and no legacy product,
compatibility, migration, or deprecation line. Existing pre-release formats,
backends, names, APIs, missing-field defaults, and alternate success paths are
either part of the accepted target or superseded implementation residue. The
accepted result contains no alternate database, query, graph, vector,
security, context, or lifecycle path and no forwarding alias, old-shape
decoder, read-old/write-new branch, or migration executor that keeps
superseded RRFlow state executable.

Before an existing implementation is replaced or removed, its useful
semantics, invariants, tests, fixtures, and measured behavior must be mapped to
the canonical boundary and owning roadmap gate. The
[implementation-requirements traceability matrix](../roadmap/rrflow-1.0-execution-map.md#implementation-requirements-traceability)
is the execution control for that accounting. A branch relationship, merge,
rename, compilation result, or file deletion does not prove that behavior was
integrated.

Direct convergence follows one absorption rule:

1. Read the complete affected source, test, fixture, and owning record.
2. Classify each behavior as required canonical semantics, a useful invariant
   to generalize, or superseded residue to remove.
3. Bind every retained requirement to one canonical module, operation, data
   family, and acceptance test under `RrdEngine`.
4. Implement and prove the equal-or-stronger canonical behavior.
5. Remove the competing reader, default, alias, format, path, success fixture,
   and terminology in the same owning gate. Retain earlier bytes only as a
   negative rejection fixture when they materially prove fail-closed behavior.

Interoperability terms such as type-compatible Arrow buffers, compatible
embedding spaces, S3-compatible APIs, and negotiated public protocol versions
describe current technical contracts; they do not authorize an older RRFlow
execution path. An upstream dependency namespace that happens to contain the
word `legacy` is likewise not an RRFlow surface, but it must remain isolated
behind its owning adapter.

## Persistence and memory boundary

rrflowDB is the persistent logical estate. rrflowKV is its physical storage
engine. The rrflowKV memtable is the hot mutable tier inside a persistent
rrflowDB instance.

rrflowMX is different: it is an intentionally non-durable composition for
volatile and conformance execution. It does not silently flush or promote into
rrflowDB. Moving state from rrflowMX to rrflowDB requires an explicit,
authorized `RrdEngine` transaction whose result is subject to the ordinary
schema, policy, audit, and durability rules.

## Native multi-model boundary

Temporal records, claims, relations, reasoning trees, project-tree snapshots,
graph adjacency, lexical postings, vectors, engine events, routine state, skill
bindings, and evidence are rrflowDB data families. They share one transaction
coordinator, read-stamp model, canonical runtime log, and persistence authority.

The temporal graph is not another graph database. RRFlow vector search is not
a separately authoritative vector database. BM25 is not another text store.
Exact vector values may be canonical rrflowDB values; HNSW and quantized
structures are derived candidate indexes and cannot outrank their source data.

## Query and analytical boundary

rrflowQL selects a native fast path or the analytical path. Fast point, range,
CAS, and bounded graph navigation does not require DataFusion. Analytical work
reads one authorized stamp, obtains native KV/graph/lexical/vector candidates,
streams eligible rrflowKV state as Arrow batches, and evaluates bounded
DataFusion operators before deterministic exact reranking or reciprocal-rank
fusion.

DataFusion computes. It never owns the database, WAL, authorization decision,
read stamp, or commit. Any transformed result returns to `RrdEngine` as a
proposal and passes semantic validation and authorization before persistence.

The accepted detailed flow and current implementation differences are owned
by [engine-data-flow.md](engine-data-flow.md). In particular, the present
checkout still materializes rows into newly allocated Arrow arrays and has not
implemented the target Arrow-compatible rrflowKV segment pages.

## Security boundary

RRFlow Security is cross-cutting and enforced by `RrdEngine`:

| Boundary | Required authority | Prohibited bypass |
|---|---|---|
| Ingress | Typed public operation and bounded request | Transport-specific semantic execution |
| Identity and session | Authenticated principal, lease, and instance scope | Provider identity becoming an RRFlow authority |
| Read | Policy, valid time, and one `ReadStamp` | Index, model, or client selecting unstamped state |
| Compute | Authorized plan and resource budget | DataFusion or LFG granting permissions |
| Mutation | Schema validation, effect authorization, and transaction coordination | Direct model, adapter, hook, or DataFusion storage writes |
| Evidence | Correlated audit, plan, source, and commit coordinates | Trace events substituting for canonical state |

## Source and distribution boundary

RRFlow is self-contained at two different boundaries that must not be
conflated:

| Boundary | Must contain | Must not require |
|---|---|---|
| First-party source | Every RRFlow engine, persistence, query, vector, inference-adapter, transport, install, attunement, release, verification, backup, and recovery implementation; all schemas, templates, fixtures, and generated-source inputs | A sibling checkout, local path outside the repository, Git submodule, untracked generator, or host-specific absolute path |
| Signed default distribution | RRD and operator executables; linked rrflowKV, rrflowQL, Arrow/DataFusion, graph, BM25, vector, security, and engine code; public schemas/goldens; bootstrap and attunement templates; default configuration; runtime/model assets required by the declared default profile; verifier; licenses/SBOM; recovery material and runbook | A compiler, Cargo/npm cache, package registry, source checkout, external database/query/vector service, Connectome, mesh, or provider connection |

The source build may resolve content-locked third-party packages through the
normal toolchain. That does not authorize a deployed RRFlow instance to fetch
code or required runtime assets. Release assembly records dependency digests
and licenses, and installation must work with outbound network access denied
after the signed bundle is acquired. An optional model or adapter bundle may be
side-loaded only when the operator selects it explicitly; anything required by
the default profile belongs in the default distribution.

Connectome remains a separate client release. PostgreSQL, Turso, SQLite,
Dragonfly, object stores, Zuul Zero/shippin.ai meshes, and model providers
remain optional integrations. None is needed to make a local rrflowKV estate
ready, commit data, close, reopen, recover, or verify itself.

## Client bootstrap boundary

Connectome is an optional operator and developer workbench, not part of the
engine source or default readiness authority. Its first connection to an RRD
instance uses the public HTTP operations in this order:

```text
GET /v1/health/live
GET /v1/health/ready
GET /v1/capabilities
```

The client accepts the runtime only after validating the RRD protocol version
and returned instance resource. Plain HTTP is restricted to loopback;
off-device or mesh-resolved endpoints require HTTPS. A Zuul Zero or
shippin.ai adapter may resolve a devspace endpoint and carry opaque transport
attestation, but reachability does not authenticate the RRD instance and the
mesh never owns database state.

Connectome invokes installation, attunement, context, query, trace, and live
delivery through public RRD capabilities. It does not reproduce phase state,
retrieval, authorization, or persistence in the client. The
[Connectome client contract](../reference/client/connectome.md) owns connection,
projection, interaction, local-state, and client-conformance requirements. The
[agent-bootstrap reference](../reference/agent-bootstrap.md#installation-and-attunement)
owns the project-installation and attunement contract; roadmap
[H-06](../roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md#gate-h--prove-context-flow-feedback-live-delivery-and-connectome)
owns the real-client acceptance evidence.

## External integrations

PostgreSQL, Turso, SQLite, Dragonfly, application databases, object stores,
mesh networks, and model providers are operator-configured external
integrations. Attunement may discover them but cannot activate them. They never
become rrflowDB's implicit persistence, transaction, query, security, or
context authority.

## Documentation and future memory

During bootstrap, Markdown records remain the reviewed authoring authority.
The root and boundary READMEs are portals now, and each warp retains one local
checkout fallback. The deterministic JSON/JSONL knowledge package is a
generated, content-addressed import artifact rather than a second editable
truth.

rrflowDB becomes the normal durable warp-resolution path only after authorized
import, readback, restart, idempotency, drift-denial, and recovery evidence
passes. Architecture explanations live here, decisions live under
`docs/decisions/`, exact contracts live under `docs/reference/`, delivery order
lives in the roadmap, and observed gaps live in the POA&M.
