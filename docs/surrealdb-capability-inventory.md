# SurrealDB capability inventory and RRFlow disposition

Status: supporting point-in-time research inventory, not current RRFlow status
or roadmap. `README.md` is authoritative when a disposition has changed.

**Baseline:** SurrealDB `3.2.4`, the latest stable release on 2026-08-23.
SurrealDB `3.3.0-beta.3` additions are isolated in the preview section and are
not treated as stable. This is a product-capability inventory: individual
SurrealQL functions and every CLI/configuration flag are grouped under their
own capability families rather than misrepresented as separate products.

This document exists because RRFlow cannot make a meaningful competitive or
optimization claim against a database whose complete product surface has not
first been enumerated. The old `3.0.5` differential remains a bounded engine
diagnostic only.

## Status language

| Status | Meaning in this repository |
|---|---|
| **Verified** | Executable RRFlow code and a retained test/evidence path exist. |
| **Partial** | A real subset exists, but it does not provide SurrealDB's complete capability. |
| **Absent** | No executable RRFlow product capability exists. |
| **External** | Intentionally supplied by another RRFlow component or provider; the adapter/contract must still exist. |

Maturity is deliberately conservative. A Rust type, a UI label, or a design
document alone is not implementation.

## 1. Product form, tenancy, and deployment

Sources: [deployment models](https://surrealdb.com/docs/build/deployment),
[what SurrealDB is](https://surrealdb.com/docs/what-is-surrealdb), and
[Cloud scaling](https://surrealdb.com/docs/manage/cloud/scaling).

| SurrealDB capability | Edition/state | RRFlow disposition |
|---|---|---|
| One Rust database engine exposed as a server and embeddable library | Community | **Partial** — RRFlow has libraries and several binaries, but not one stable public database distribution/API. |
| In-memory embedded engine | Community | **Verified** — `MemoryEngine`; test/reference use, not a separately versioned SDK product. |
| Browser/WASM embedded engine using IndexedDB | Community | **Absent** |
| Native embedded engines for Rust, Node.js, and WASM clients | Community | **Absent** as supported SDK distributions |
| Offline and edge deployment | Community | **Partial** — `rrflow-edge` is executable and offline, but its database/query surface is narrow. |
| Standalone single-node persistent server | Community | **Partial** — native persistence exists; `rrflow-mcp` is an MCP runtime rather than a full network database server. |
| Docker deployment | Community | **Absent** as a supported, tested product artifact |
| Self-hosted Kubernetes deployment | Community/Enterprise | **Absent** |
| Distributed multi-node database | Enterprise (`SurrealDS`); TiKV development path | **Partial/experimental** — real Raft adapter and TLS process tests exist; production service, independent-host and operational qualification do not. |
| Managed Cloud database | Commercial | **Absent** |
| Vertical and horizontal instance scaling | Cloud/Enterprise | **Absent** |
| High-availability managed Scale clusters | Cloud/Enterprise | **Absent** |
| Namespace and database hierarchy for multi-tenancy | Community | **Partial** — scopes and isolated instance manifests exist; full namespace/database administration does not. |
| Organisation, users, projects/instances, regions and plans as managed estates | Cloud | **Partial UI model only** — Connectome has local `EstateView`/`InstanceView`; no authoritative control plane provisions or reconciles estates. |
| One query/API contract across embedded, server, and distributed modes | Product-wide | **Absent** — RRFlow ports share semantics internally, but no stable multi-language/network contract spans every mode. |

## 2. Persistence, transactions, and lifecycle

[3.2 release](https://surrealdb.com/releases/3.2), and
[self-hosted backup guidance](https://surrealdb.com/docs/manage/self-hosted/backups-and-recovery).

| SurrealDB capability | RRFlow disposition |
|---|---|
| Multi-record and multi-table ACID transactions | **Verified locally** for one canonical runtime transaction across RRFlow value families |
| Explicit `BEGIN` / `COMMIT` / `CANCEL` transactions | **Partial** — bounded RRFlowQL transaction programs execute typed mutation bindings through the canonical engine coordinator; public network/session adapters remain open |
| Client-owned transactions over RPC/SDKs | **Absent** |
| Read-your-writes transaction views | **Verified locally** |
| Optimistic conflict detection and atomic rollback | **Verified locally** |
| Durable WAL with corruption/torn-tail recovery | **Verified locally** in RRD LSM |
| MVCC historical versions and repeatable stamped reads | **Verified locally** |
| Versioned/temporal reads where supported by the storage engine | **Verified locally** with explicit valid/known time; wider RRFlowQL coverage is partial |
| Persisted snapshot leases and retention pins | **Verified locally** |
| Named physical checkpoints/snapshots | **Verified locally** |
| Authenticated physical snapshot bundle export/install | **Verified locally** |
| Background compaction and garbage collection | **Verified locally**, but production scheduling/tuning remains partial |
| Resumable datastore migrations and on-disk version history | **Partial** — manifest/codec compatibility and Fjall migration exist; general schema/data migration ledger does not |
| Memory, SurrealKV, RocksDB, IndexedDB, TiKV, and SurrealDS backend choices | **External/absent** — RRFlow has Memory, RRD LSM, and Fjall compatibility, not those backend products |
| Durable RPC sessions with TTL cleanup | **Absent** |
| Bounded abandoned client transactions | **Absent** because public client transactions are absent |
| Logical export/import of namespaces, schema, users, indexes and data | **Absent** as a complete portable database archive |
| Managed scheduled and on-demand backups with configurable retention | **Absent** |

| Multivectors | **Verified locally** for exact storage/oracle |
| Full-text documents and analyzers | **Verified locally** — content-addressed BM25 v2 artifacts retain analyzer, positions, offsets, relevance, and highlighting evidence |
| Hybrid full-text/vector retrieval and rank fusion | **Verified in the engine** — one-stamp bounded keyword+dense+sparse RRF composes with governed boost, exact/model MaxSim, and MMR reranking; generated public bindings remain open |
| Key-value access patterns | **Verified internally**; not a supported public KV API |
| First-class file pointers and buckets | **Partial** — content-addressed object references/stores exist; file namespace and full operations do not |
| Memory/filesystem bucket backends | **Partial** — local immutable objects only |

| SurrealDB capability | RRFlow disposition |
|---|---|
| Horizontally scaled query nodes over shared distributed storage | **Absent** |
| Replication, consensus and fault tolerance | **Partial/experimental** |
| Distributed ACID transactions | **Absent** — RRFlow Raft serializes one canonical state domain; this is not a general distributed transaction service |
| Cluster membership changes and placement epochs | **Verified protocol slice**, not production operations |
| Replica snapshot catch-up and WAL-delta recovery | **Verified protocol slice** |
| Immutable object closure transfer before state activation | **Verified locally** |

## 13. SurrealDB 3.3 preview — not part of the stable baseline

Source: [SurrealDB 3.3 beta release notes](https://surrealdb.com/releases/3.3).

These capabilities must be tracked so RRFlow does not build against an already
obsolete target, but they are marked preview until SurrealDB ships stable 3.3:

- Postgres wire protocol with simple/extended query flows, TLS, SCRAM-SHA-256,
  prepared parameters, cancellation, and interactive transactions.
- ISO GQL enabled by default.
- Native gRPC engine and end-to-end streamed results.
- WebSocket and embedded JS query streaming with bounded backpressure.
- Open-source S3/S3-compatible, GCS, and Azure bucket storage.
- Bitmap fusion for indexed `AND`/`OR`/`NOT`, index-only counts, and
  pre-filtered HNSW/DiskANN traversal.
- Datastore semantic-version ledger and resumable startup migrations.
- Runtime-swappable capability policy for embedders.
- S3-backed SurrealDS storage plus bounded recovery/admission improvements.

RRFlow currently has no Postgres wire, gRPC query server, bitmap payload-index
fusion, or cloud-backed distributed persistence. Its typed query batches,
capability gates, and S3 semantic port are prerequisites, not equivalents.

## 14. Immediate conclusion

RRFlow has a substantive local runtime kernel: authenticated persistence,
multi-family atomic commits, bitemporal reads, typed graph/history, exact and
dense-HNSW vector paths, snapshots, object closure, reasoning enforcement,
cluster protocol evidence, and unusually rich temporal diagnostics. It does
**not** yet have the SurrealDB full stack. The largest blockers are the public
server/session/transaction surface, complete RRFlowQL mutations and indexes,
live subscriptions, comprehensive identity/security, supported SDKs,
backup/export/restore, production operations, and a real estate control plane.

Those gaps must be implemented and verified before any claim that RRFlow is a
SurrealDB competitor rather than a promising runtime/storage kernel.
