# RRD server v1 implementation contract

Status: supporting implemented transaction, identity, and authorization foundations
implemented. The async loopback HTTP boundary, authenticated TLS 1.3 mTLS
remote boundary, persistent transaction coordinator, API-key/JWT session
exchange, and constrained RRFlowQL policy path are shipped; broader
administration, query cancellation, metrics, mutating-query, and
released-client exit gates remain open.

The first RRD server is a new process boundary, not an HTTP wrapper around the
CLI and not an extension of `rrflow-mcp`'s MCP protocol. `rrflow-mcp` remains the AI-tool
adapter. Both consume `rrd-contract`; neither owns persistence semantics.

## Initial deployment boundary

Plain HTTP may bind only to an explicit loopback address. Non-loopback
cleartext startup fails closed. A TLS listener may bind remotely only when it
requires a client certificate rooted in the configured CA and the target
instance already has initialized `rrd-security` state. Session creation then
requires a principal/API key or a configured RRD-issued JWT, persists that
principal and credential revision on the lease, and every authenticated route
rechecks its closed action and exact resource policy. RRFlowQL additionally
injects current tenant/row/field restrictions before binding and planning.
With no security state, sessions remain an explicitly advertised loopback
development transport mode and TLS/JWT startup is denied. Certificate reload,
external OIDC/JWK verification, secret-provider integration, and comprehensive
audit remain F4 follow-on gates. Project/instance provisioning is an explicit
offline command; serving never creates or rewrites topology.

Capability negotiation reports loopback/plain operation as `local_daemon` and
mutual-TLS operation as `remote`. These are service faces of the same
`RrdEngine`, not separate persistence implementations. The standalone-process
conformance test proves that the local daemon exclusively owns its native root,
serves the shared logical corpus, shuts down cleanly, and leaves an exactly
reopenable cursor. See
[`rrd-deployment-modes-v1.md`](rrd-deployment-modes-v1.md).

Start the local process with:

```text
cargo run -p rrd-server -- initialize --root PROJECT --instance INSTANCE
cargo run -p rrd-server -- --root PROJECT --bind 127.0.0.1:9477
```

The experimental remote path requires all three PEM inputs together:

```text
rrd-server --root PROJECT --bind 0.0.0.0:9477 \
  --tls-cert SERVER_CHAIN.pem --tls-key SERVER_KEY.pem \
  --tls-client-ca CLIENT_CA.pem \
  --jwt-key-file JWT_SIGNING_KEY
```

Rustls is restricted to TLS 1.3 for this listener. HTTP/1.1 connections are
currently one request per connection; connection pooling, live certificate
rotation, CRLs/OCSP, and Kubernetes Secret integration remain open.

`--jwt-key-file` is optional and enables RRD-issued HS256 bearer exchange for
session creation. The file must be regular, bounded, and owner-only on Unix;
its SHA-256 must match one persisted issuer. Raw JWT and key bytes are held only
in memory and are excluded from the security authority, session records, audit,
and control journal.

The database-local `RRD.SERVER.SECRET` is generated from OS entropy, requires
owner-only permissions on Unix, and makes lease-token derivation stable across
restart without storing bearer tokens. Supplying `--token-key-file PATH`
places that secret elsewhere. `X-RRD-Session` carries the session identifier;
`Authorization: Bearer TOKEN` carries its transport lease.

## HTTP resources

- `GET /v1/health/live` proves only that the process can answer.
- `GET /v1/health/ready` opens the configured instance, verifies its format,
  reads claim/runtime watermarks, and reports maintenance/cutover denial.
- `GET /v1/capabilities` returns the frozen `ServiceCapabilities` envelope.
- `GET /v1/schema/endpoints` returns the machine-readable, sorted public
  operation catalogue used to generate and qualify SDK surfaces.
- `GET /v1/schema/openapi` returns deterministic OpenAPI 3.1 derived from that
  catalogue and every public Rust wire type; its canonical digest is frozen.
- `POST /v1/sessions` creates a bounded lease with idle and absolute expiry,
  maximum concurrent transactions, and a server-generated secret token. On a
  secured instance it first requires `X-RRD-Principal` and
  `Authorization: ApiKey …`; the resulting session cannot change principal.
- `POST /v1/sessions/{session}/renew` rotates the token and never extends past
  absolute expiry.
- `POST /v1/query` authenticates the session, requires the exact
  `instance:<server-instance>` scope, and executes bounded RRFlowQL through the
  RRD query executor binder, planner, and executor. The typed response includes the
  canonical query, read manifest, cursor, schema revision, selected and
  rejected plan candidates, execution evidence, and rows. This endpoint is a
  read-only F6 walking skeleton; mutating RRFlowQL and live subscriptions remain
  open.
- `POST /v1/query/live/poll` authenticates the session under a separate
  deny-by-default action and returns bounded added/updated/removed row deltas
  from an exact resume cursor through one captured head. A caller may request a
  bounded wait of up to five seconds; the server wakes when the authoritative
  cursor advances, rejects waits beyond the request deadline, and reports
  timeout/wait duration explicitly. Streaming/backpressure and retained
  subscriptions remain open.
- `POST /v1/query/indexes/ensure` requires a mutation idempotency key and a
  distinct index-administration grant. It validates scalar/compound unique,
  count, grouped-count, geo, filtered materialized-view, or configurable BM25
  definitions; creates or rebuilds one exact stamped artifact; records a
  durable replay receipt; and returns generation/cursor/valid-time/digests plus
  maintenance and analytics summaries. Same-key payload drift conflicts.
- `POST /v1/query/indexes/list` returns the ordered authoritative index
  catalogue under a separate read grant. Authoritative commits do not rebuild
  derived artifacts; stale generations are rejected by planning while ready
  unique definitions remain enforced at commit.
- `POST /v1/vector/search` captures an authenticated runtime read stamp and
  runs bounded dense, sparse, or multi-vector search through the canonical
  RRFlow vector planner and exact oracle. The response includes manifest/cursor,
  scan evidence, plan digest, selected access path, exactness, score, source
  cursor, and typed vector/subject identities. Public filters and persisted
  HNSW/TurboQuant artifact serving remain open.
- `POST /v1/changes/read` returns one bounded retained page after an exact
  global cursor. Sparse scoped feeds advance through the source cursor even
  when no scoped change matches. Each entry carries commit/ordinal/scope/time/
  actor coordinates, prior and current change SHA-256, a lossless claim
  snapshot or typed public data mutation, and authenticated-read evidence.
  Clients resume from `through_cursor`; bounded long-poll is available through
  the separate follow operation.
- `POST /v1/changes/follow` waits at most five seconds for the first retained
  page after the supplied cursor and returns either that page or an explicit
  timeout at the newest observed `through_cursor`. It uses the same typed replay
  contract and remains the non-streaming compatibility path.
- `POST /v1/subscriptions/open` and `/close` administer engine-owned durable
  changefeed/live-query definitions. The authenticated
  `/v1/subscriptions/{subscription}/stream` WebSocket provides push delivery,
  cumulative ACK, bounded in-flight backpressure, renewable leases, retention
  floors, fenced reconnect, and restart-safe replay from the global cursor.
- `POST /v1/backups` creates and verifies a logical archive in the server's
  generated per-instance backup root. The operation is durably prepared before
  the archive effect, bound to its idempotency key and operation digest, and
  replayed without creating a second archive after restart.
- `POST /v1/backups/list` authenticates the backup catalogue and optionally
  verifies every retained archive before returning its explicit coverage.
- `POST /v1/restores` verifies a selected content-addressed archive and restores
  it into a generated, absent `restore_id` root. It reopens and checks the
  restored claim/runtime watermarks before completing. It never overwrites or
  switches the active instance root.
- `POST /v1/audit/read` requires the session principal to hold `audit_read` on
  the exact resource and returns a bounded page of redacted typed outcomes from
  the authenticated control journal. Its resume coordinate advances across
  non-audit transitions.
- `POST /v1/estates/{estate}/read` returns the typed public `EstateSnapshot`
  for a resource path containing that estate and this server instance. It
  requires a live session token, exposes no raw idempotency keys, and performs
  no estate mutation. On secured instances the session principal must also
  hold the exact `estate_read` grant.
- `DELETE /v1/sessions/{session}` closes the session and aborts its open
  transactions idempotently.
- `POST /v1/transactions` captures an Engine read stamp and creates one
  server-side transaction lease bound to exactly one instance and either the
  legacy `claims` scope or typed `data` scope.
- `POST /v1/transactions/{transaction}/preview` is the durable prepare
  operation. It requires a mutation idempotency key, freezes the ordered write
  set and runtime time, and returns the canonical digest plus a complete
  prospective all-model `DataSnapshot` at the transaction's exact read stamp.
  It does not publish a runtime cursor. Exact replay survives restart; either
  key or payload substitution conflicts.
- `POST /v1/transactions/{transaction}/commit` requires a mutation
  idempotency key, exact operation digest, and deadline; it commits through
  the matching authoritative Engine transaction. The `claims` scope retains
  `Engine::append_batch_idempotent`. The `data` scope lowers the public typed
  schema, claim, record, relation, event, vector, series, geo, and pre-staged
  object-reference vocabulary into one atomic `RuntimeCommit` with exact
  cursor conflict detection.
- `DELETE /v1/transactions/{transaction}` aborts idempotently.

Every response uses `ResponseEnvelope`; every failure uses the stable
`ErrorCode`. Payload schemas must be added to `rrd-contract` before handler
code, and public payloads must not serialize private `rrd_core` types.
Mutating envelopes require a client idempotency key. Operation digests use
`rrd_contract::transaction_operation_sha256`, which hashes the stable typed
JSON mutation order rather than arbitrary incoming object-key order; its
golden vector is checked into the public-contract tests.

## Persistent idempotency

An in-memory key map is insufficient. The server requires one authoritative
keyspace binding `(instance, session, idempotency_key)` to operation SHA-256 and
the accepted response identity in the same commit as the mutation. Replaying
the same key/digest returns the original result; the same key with a different
digest returns `conflict`; no accepted mutation may be repeated after server
restart. Session creation and transaction begin derive stable identities from
the server secret plus the client key. Renew, close, abort, and commit retain
their accepted key/digest bindings in session state. Runtime commit content
identity remains a second independent guard.

## Authoritative lifecycle journal

Session and transaction state is not process memory and the journal is not a
best-effort log. Every accepted lifecycle transition uses Engine compare-and-
swap to update its materialized record and append a monotonically sequenced,
SHA-256-chained journal entry in the same storage transaction. Each entry
contains event time, actor/action, request and operation identities, the prior
state digest, and the complete replacement state required to replay it.

Persisted session state and journal entries contain only the session-token
SHA-256; raw bearer tokens are derived for responses and never journaled.
Session expiry atomically marks all open transactions expired. Begin,
transaction prepare, commit intent, commit completion, abort, renewal, close,
transaction expiry, and session expiry have explicit lifecycle events. An idempotent response
replay does not invent a second lifecycle transition. Successful activity
advances idle expiry but never crosses absolute expiry. A compare-and-swap
conflict fails closed rather than overwriting a concurrent lifecycle event.

Claim and data acceptance use a recoverable three-transition protocol until
the broader F6 transaction engine owns it as one generalized transaction: first
`transaction.commit_prepared` durably binds the only permitted key/digest,
then the authoritative claim or runtime commit stores its receipt atomically
with data, then `transaction.committed` records the terminal state. A data
intent also freezes runtime time and content digest; recovery resolves that
digest through the authoritative runtime commit catalogue. A stop at either
gap resumes only the prepared identity and cannot accept a different retry
key or duplicate data. Recovery after process restart is exercised. This is
deliberately not presented as one cross-keyspace commit.

## Time and resource invariants

- The process reads its clock once per request and passes that value inward.
- An already-expired request is denied before storage I/O.
- A deadline expiring before commit publication returns `deadline_exceeded`
  only if no commit was accepted; otherwise the durable accepted result wins.
- Session/transaction counts, body bytes, mutation count, and lease duration
  have configured hard bounds. Result-byte and execution-time caps remain
  open for generalized work. Query input, parameter count/bytes, scanned
  changes, returned rows, batch rows, and encoded output bytes are bounded by
  the public query contract.
- Expiry cleanup is idempotent and never deletes canonical data.
- Disconnect does not imply abort or commit; the transaction remains governed
  by its lease and idempotency identity.

## Black-box exit matrix

The current real-socket matrix proves liveness/readiness on reopen, capability
negotiation, malformed/oversized-body denial, wrong-instance denial, elapsed
deadline denial before mutation, token rotation and replay, idle expiry,
transaction quota, durable all-model prepare/read-your-writes, explicit abort
and close, same-process and post-restart commit replay, idempotency collision,
lost-response cancellation followed by process restart and retry,
concurrent same-operation convergence, graceful shutdown, and refusal by both
the library and real binary to bind cleartext remotely. The mTLS matrix proves
trusted-client success, missing-client-certificate denial, wrong-server-name
denial, exact capability advertisement, and the requirement for initialized
application security.

The matrix also proves that an unauthenticated estate read is denied, URL and
resource-estate identities must agree, and the response is the public snapshot
rather than the persisted authority document.

The real-socket matrix proves the same authentication and scope denial for the
query endpoint and verifies an exact persisted-record query, typed row output,
planner candidates, validation evidence, and cursor/schema coordinates.

The multi-model socket fixture also searches its committed vector through the
public service, proves unauthenticated denial, and observes an exact cosine hit
bound to the same runtime cursor and source change.

The fixture pages the same eleven-change commit as `3 + 8`, verifies
hash-chain continuity across the page boundary, preserves full claim
provenance and typed mutation bodies, restarts, and resumes exactly at cursor
ten to retrieve cursor eleven without replaying earlier entries.

A separate real-socket test starts a follow at cursor two, commits an event at
cursor three from another connection, observes the waiting request wake with
that typed event, then proves a subsequent follow times out cleanly at cursor
three with no fabricated change.

The managed-recovery fixture denies an unauthenticated backup, creates and
verifies a logical archive, proves key/digest collision denial, lists the
authenticated catalogue, restores to a generated new root, reopens that root,
and replays both operations after a server restart without duplicating either
effect. Public requests contain no filesystem path. The server derives
`rrd-service/<instance>/backups` and
`rrd-service/<instance>/restores/<restore-id>` beneath the configured database
parent. Archive labels are operation-qualified internally so an effect can be
found after an acknowledgement gap.

It also prepares all nine runtime mutation families through one `data`
transaction, proves the prospective snapshot contains the uncommitted writes
while the authoritative cursor remains unchanged, restarts, and replays the
same prepare. It then commits the single eleven-change cursor interval and
one-claim receipt, restarts again, replays the same runtime commit identity,
and confirms that the authoritative scoped log contains exactly eleven changes.

The secured-socket differential records public inspection, an unknown route,
missing and wrong API-key session denials, an allowed exact query, an ungranted
backup denial, a missing-bearer denial, and a granted but invalid query failure.
Authorized session/query/audit work has a durable pre-execution reservation;
the protected audit read returns thirteen authorization/completion records with
only request/response digests. Reopened journal evidence contains neither raw
API key nor authorization scheme.

The JWT socket differential issues a bounded token, exchanges it for a durable
session, executes an allowed field projection, denies and audits a forbidden
field, restarts and replays the exact session request, rotates the principal
credential revision, then proves both the old JWT and the already-issued lease
return 401. A recursive persisted-tree check excludes the token and mounted
signing key.

F2 is not closed by that matrix. Remaining black-box gates are cancellation of
long-running query work, deadline races during generalized commit,
mutating RRFlowQL,
CRUD/schema/vector/snapshot administration, generalized result/time limits,
durable query-span export, metrics export, and released-version negotiation
clients. Backup object payloads remain referenced-only and the service does not
deploy or switch a restored root. A process-kill matrix at the exact
filesystem-effect/control-record gap remains a qualification gate even though
restart recovery is implemented for that gap.
F4 audit still requires application-mutation/audit-completion atomicity,
explicit oversized-body/handler-failure coverage, retention/rotation, and
external archival.
