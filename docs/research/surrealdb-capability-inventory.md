# SurrealDB v3.2.4 capability reference

**Status:** active, source-pinned external-system research; not RRFlow architecture, implementation status, or delivery authority
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/research/surrealdb-capability-inventory`
**Owner:** SurrealDB capability taxonomy, pinned implementation anchors, and bounded adaptation inputs for RRFlow
**Reviewed:** 2026-09-08
**Upstream baseline:** SurrealDB `v3.2.4`, lightweight tag at verified commit `93ab219d69f09d8f999851b0359c80ebe6726102`
**Preview watchpoint:** SurrealDB `v3.3.0-beta.3`, commit `6dce5c84e29ff6c12b73c401b2251566e1aeca60`; not a stable baseline

This record answers one question: which SurrealDB behaviors and failure cases
are useful reference inputs while RRFlow builds one persistent multi-model AI
governance, reasoning, and recall engine? It does not make SurrealDB a
dependency, sidecar, compatibility target, storage format, query language,
topology, or public product model. It cannot mark an RRFlow roadmap gate
complete.

RRFlow terms and current maturity come from the repository
[`README.md`](../../README.md). Required outcomes, dependency order, and open
deficiencies remain owned by the
[alpha objective](../objectives/rrflow-1.0-alpha.md),
[roadmap](../roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md), and
[POA&M](../poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha.md). The accepted engine composition and
context path are defined in
[`system-overview.md`](../architecture/system-overview.md) and
[`engine-data-flow.md`](../architecture/engine-data-flow.md).

## Research boundary

The technical baseline is the exact stable source commit above, SurrealDB's
3.2 release line, and first-party documentation available on the review date.
Documentation pages describe a moving product; source links below are pinned
to immutable commit coordinates. A later RRFlow implementation package must
repin any upstream behavior it actually adapts and identify its exact symbol,
test, issue, or failure report.

This is a technical provenance record, not a legal-rights determination. Even
when source use is authorized, RRFlow extracts only a bounded invariant,
algorithm, layout idea, test shape, or failure case; gives it an RRFlow-owned
destination; rejects incompatible assumptions; and proves the resulting
behavior independently. No package may copy an upstream directory tree,
retain SurrealDB names or encodings as first-party RRFlow vocabulary, or add a
successful compatibility path.

SurrealDB and RRFlow overlap, but they are not the same product:

- SurrealDB is a general multi-model database organized around namespaces,
  databases, tables, records, relations, indexes, functions, users, and
  multiple storage/deployment choices.
- RRFlow is one per-project AI estate observed through `RrdEngine`. Canonical
  project knowledge, temporal graph state, reasoning state, evidence,
  feedback, and native scalar/BM25/vector projections share one transaction
  model; `rrflowMX` and `rrflowKV` are volatile and durable profiles of those
  same semantics.
- `rrflowQL` is RRFlow's bounded query and analytical planning surface.
  DataFusion is embedded compute over read-stamped Arrow streams, never a
  second database or a writer of canonical state.
- PostgreSQL, Turso, Dragonfly, object stores, meshes, model providers, and
  application databases are optional installed adapters or governed sources.
  They do not become an RRFlow storage backend merely because a project uses
  them.

## Pinned upstream source topology

The source tree was resolved at the stable commit; the listed anchors were
inspected selectively for architecture and failure semantics. Their presence
does not imply that RRFlow adopts their types or module layout.

| Stable source anchor | Behavior studied | RRFlow use |
|---|---|---|
| [`surrealdb/core/src/dbs`](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/tree/93ab219d69f09d8f999851b0359c80ebe6726102/surrealdb/core/src/dbs) | Execution context, iterator orchestration, capabilities, and query-level coordination. | Reference for keeping modular executors under one semantic authority, not for importing a second executor. |
| [`surrealdb/core/src/doc`](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/tree/93ab219d69f09d8f999851b0359c80ebe6726102/surrealdb/core/src/doc) | One mutation pipeline coordinates field/schema work, records, edges, indexes, events, changefeeds, and live notifications. | Reference for an effect-complete `RrdEngine` commit plan. |

| [`surrealdb/core/src/kvs/tx.rs`](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/blob/93ab219d69f09d8f999851b0359c80ebe6726102/surrealdb/core/src/kvs/tx.rs) | Transaction-local caches plus pending changefeed, live-query, and index-build work around one underlying transaction. | Reference for coordinating derived effects with commit outcome behind `RrdEngine`. |

| [`surrealdb/mcp/src`](https://github.com/surrealdb/surrealdb/tree/93ab219d69f09d8f999851b0359c80ebe6726102/surrealdb/mcp/src) | MCP service, authentication, session, and tool adapters. | Reference for a thin authenticated outward adapter that cannot own context or lifecycle state. |

The stable release history is itself an important input. SurrealDB 3.2.4
bounded index-compaction draining, added an optional physical write-key cap,
and fixed a concurrent index build that could lose progress under active
writes. The 3.2.2 and 3.2.1 notes document durable RPC sessions, bounded
abandoned WebSocket transactions, live-query cache and conflict-error fixes,
resumable index builds, interruption cleanup, MVCC reclamation, exact planner
conditions, and a permission bypass inside ANN candidate evaluation. RRFlow
must retain these as adversarial cases rather than copying only happy-path
feature names.

## Capability and adaptation matrix

“Required gate” means the RRFlow behavior is unaccepted until that gate's
named evidence passes. Current types, files, and unit tests are inventory only.

| Capability family | SurrealDB v3.2.4 behavior | RRFlow adaptation rule | RRFlow owner / required gate |
|---|---|---|---|
| One modular engine | Query, document, index, key, transaction, RPC, and storage modules are separated inside one database product. | Keep focused crates/modules, but all authoritative operations compose through `RrdEngine`; physical modularity cannot create a second kernel, database, lifecycle, or context authority. | [`system-overview.md`](../architecture/system-overview.md); A-07, C-01, C-02 |
| Storage abstraction | The compute layer targets transactional point/range storage and supports several backend/deployment profiles. | `rrflowMX` and `rrflowKV` are the only alpha storage profiles. External databases are data/activity adapters. No backend selector, SurrealKV/RocksDB/TiKV compatibility, or storage-specific semantic branch survives. | C-01 through C-04, D-03, J-01 |
| Ordered key grammar | Documents, relations, indexes, catalogues, and metadata lower to ordered byte-key families. | Freeze an RRFlow binary tuple/key grammar with explicit family, estate/scope, type, identity, temporal/version, direction, index, and generation components. Lexicographic order, prefix bounds, and malformed-key denial require golden bytes and property tests. | [`rrflowkv-current-format.md`](../reference/storage/rrflowkv-current-format.md); C-01, C-05 |
| Native model families | Documents, relational records, graph relations, time-series values, geospatial values, vectors, files, and scalar/object values share one multi-model surface. | Keep each accepted RRFlow model as a typed semantic family under one identity, schema, temporal, transaction, and authorization model. Do not collapse native meaning into opaque JSON or split a family into a sidecar engine. | [`multi-model-object-contract.md`](../reference/data/multi-model-object-contract.md); C-01 through C-04, E-01 through E-04 |
| Multi-model commit | Record, graph, index, event, changefeed, and live effects are coordinated in one mutation pipeline and transaction. | `RrdEngine` compiles one authorized effect set. Canonical values, both graph directions, scalar/BM25/vector deltas, reasoning/evidence, audit, outbox, and receipt cross one rrflowMX/rrflowKV commit boundary or none do. DataFusion and adapters only return proposals. | C-02, C-03, E-01 through E-04, G-04, H-03, H-05 |
| Transactions and isolation | SurrealDB documents snapshot isolation and detects write conflicts at commit; it is not a blanket serializable-isolation claim. | State RRFlow isolation and conflict ranges explicitly. Preserve immutable read stamps and optimistic conflict denial, add predicate/range protection only where required, and never infer serializability from a successful test. | C-02, C-03, E-02, J-02 |
| Physical write fan-out | One logical row can cause record, edge, index, full-text, and cleanup writes; 3.2.4 can fail atomically at a configured write-key cap. | Admission estimates and execution counts the full physical effect set, including adjacency and index deltas. Exceeding keys/bytes/time/memory fails before or inside the transaction with no partial publication. Internal maintenance is also bounded by a separately declared policy. | C-02, C-07, E-01 through E-04, F-04, J-02 |
| Native graph traversal | Direction-specific ordered adjacency keys make traversal a bounded prefix/range operation instead of a table-wide relation scan. | Persist RRFlow-owned outgoing and incoming adjacency entries atomically with the canonical relation record. Temporal visibility, delete/retire, dangling-reference denial, self-loops, duplicate edges, and both-direction traversal require exact oracles and reopen proof. | E-01, C-03, C-04 |
| Scalar and unique indexes | Secondary, compound, count, and uniqueness indexes participate in mutation and planning. | Maintain scalar/compound/unique entries in the semantic transaction. A uniqueness constraint is authoritative even while a derived access artifact rebuilds; planner selection requires exact stamp/configuration/cardinality evidence. | E-02, C-02, E-05 |
| Schema and stored behavior | Schema definitions, functions, events, and stored behavior are catalogued database capabilities. | Schema revisions, functions, triggers, routines, and skills remain separately typed, digest-bound, policy-gated engine records. Stored behavior may propose or schedule work but cannot create a parallel lifecycle, persistence, authorization, or query authority. | [`schema-catalogue.md`](../reference/data/schema-catalogue.md), [`functions.md`](../reference/automation/functions.md); D-02, H-05, I-01 through I-07 |
| Full-text and vector indexes | Full-text and vector structures are native index families selected by the planner. | Keep incremental RRFlow BM25 postings and Qdrant-informed vector/HNSW projections as distinct typed paths under the same stamp. Neither replaces canonical data; both retain an exact oracle and deterministic rerank/fusion evidence. | [`qdrant-capability-inventory.md`](qdrant-capability-inventory.md); E-03 through E-05, F-03 |
| Concurrent index lifecycle | Builds and rebuilds have generations, progress, takeover/restart, cleanup, and publication concerns; stable releases fixed lost progress, starvation, and unbounded queues. | Use engine-owned jobs, leases, checkpoints, source cursors, bounded batches, fair scheduling, quarantine, and atomic ready-generation publication. A build cannot resume from zero silently or claim readiness from an emitted event. | C-07, E-02 through E-04, H-05, I-03 |
| Query planning | Source, predicates, permissions, available indexes, and exactness determine physical access. Planner bugs can return wrong counts or leak restricted ANN candidates. | Bind authorization and one `ReadStamp` before planning. Cost candidates include point/range, adjacency, scalar/BM25/vector, exact scan, and Arrow/DataFusion operators; security predicates must be enforced at the earliest candidate-producing operator and revalidated at delivery. | E-05, F-02 through F-04, H-04, H-05 |
| Query languages | SurrealQL, GraphQL, and experimental GQL lower onto SurrealDB execution. | RRFlow accepts typed operations and rrflowQL. GraphQL may lower through the public contract, but no SurrealQL/GQL syntax, behavior, RPC, or compatibility promise enters the engine. Parsing never grants mutation authority. | B-05, F-01 through F-03, H-04 |
| Analytical execution | SurrealDB's streaming query engine is not Apache DataFusion and does not define RRFlow's Arrow-page contract. | rrflowKV exposes pinned, read-stamped Arrow-compatible page streams; rrflowQL composes native access with bounded DataFusion plans. Projection/filter/limit pushdown, buffer ownership, cancellation, spill, scan, decode, copy, allocation, and cache residency are measurable. | F-01 through F-05, C-06 |
| Live results | Live queries publish committed matching changes; durable changefeeds are a separate history/replay concern and strict total ordering must be specified by the consumer contract. | Keep durable changefeed cursor pages distinct from live semantic deltas. Derive subscription impact from the accepted commit and index changes, persist ACK/lease/backpressure state, and avoid re-running complete before/after snapshots. | H-03, B-04, H-05 |
| Security and capabilities | Authentication, permissions, row/field policy, capability gates, and candidate-time checks constrain execution; release fixes show the danger of adapter-only checks. | One engine authorization decision is bound to resource, policy revision, read stamp, plan, proposal, commit, delivery, and trace. Adapters cannot weaken it; secrets remain external references and sensitive outputs are structurally redacted. | D-01, H-04, H-05, J-02 |
| Extensions and model execution | Functions, JavaScript/Wasm execution, object/file integrations, and model/provider facilities extend the database surface. | RRFlow exposes closed, capability-scoped extension contracts only where a gate requires them. Provider-neutral embedding/model execution, immutable-object activity, and project-generator adapters enter through typed proposals and receipts; no embedded language, object store, model, or provider gains engine authority or SurrealDB compatibility. | [`functions.md`](../reference/automation/functions.md), [`embedding-and-model-bound-search.md`](../reference/inference/embedding-and-model-bound-search.md); D-03, E-04, G-02, H-04, I-01 through I-07 |
| RPC, SDK, and MCP | HTTP/WebSocket RPC, SDKs, and MCP expose the same database engine while managing session and transaction resources. | All RRFlow transports resolve one generic public operation catalogue and `RrdEngine`. MCP, Connectome, LFG, and provider adapters own carriage/presentation only; no client creates reasoning, persistence, attunement, or subscription truth. | B-04, H-04, H-07, J-01 through J-05 |
| Installation and readiness | SurrealDB publishes install forms and distinguishes liveness, backend reachability, and ready-to-serve state. Its agent material covers MCP/skill setup and repository memory ingestion. | D-01 installs one bundle-contained RRFlow instance closed by default; attunement inventories a real project incrementally and persists its jobs. Readiness proves authentication, installed binding, rrflowKV reopen, and a semantic read—not merely a bound port or uploaded folder. | D-01 through D-06, I-06, J-01, J-03, J-05 |
| Operations, observability, and recovery | Backup/restore, import/export, compaction, diagnostics, logs, metrics, and operational endpoints surround the database runtime. | RRFlow coordinates backup, archive, restore, compaction, tiering, and hibernation through typed engine jobs with leases, budgets, receipts, and correlated traces. A CLI response, open port, log line, dashboard, or copied directory is not durability or readiness proof. | [`operations/README.md`](../reference/operations/README.md), [`logical-archive.md`](../reference/storage/logical-archive.md), [`tiered-persistence.md`](../reference/storage/tiered-persistence.md); C-07, H-05, J-01 through J-05 |
| Interactive UI | Surrealist and administration surfaces expose database inspection and operations. | Connectome remains a separately deployable public client of the generic protocol. It visualizes stamped plans, graph/context evidence, jobs, subscriptions, and receipts; it cannot inspect storage internals as authority or own canonical state. | B-04, H-05, H-07, J-03 through J-05 |
| Topology and multitenancy | SurrealDB uses namespace → database → table/record plus separate cloud organization/project/instance vocabulary. | Reject that hierarchy as RRFlow authority. The first alpha remains one project ↔ one estate ↔ one instance; environment and physical placement are typed relations, not copied product tenancy levels. | [`instance-topology.md`](../architecture/instance-topology.md); D-01, D-03 |
| Distributed operation | SurrealDB has distributed products/backends with consistency, transfer, recovery, and upgrade concerns. | Use only failure, fencing, transfer, and recovery shapes for future evidence. The first alpha is single-node; no distributed claim exists until a later explicit gate proves the complete RRFlow semantic corpus on independent hosts. | J; later distributed amendment |
| Preview features | The 3.3 beta line advertises PostgreSQL wire support, gRPC streaming, object backends, bitmap fusion, and prefiltered vector work. | Treat preview behavior as a watchpoint only. It cannot change RRFlow's stable input baseline, roadmap order, product vocabulary, or acceptance claim; repin it only after a relevant implementation gate begins. | Research only until explicitly scheduled |

## Flat inventory reconciliation

The superseded flat scorecard had thirteen capability sections. This map
proves their disposition before the old file is removed; no former
“Verified” label is carried forward as RRFlow acceptance evidence.

| Superseded section | Canonical disposition |
|---|---|
| Product form, tenancy, and deployment | Split across one-engine composition, storage profiles, installation/readiness, topology, and distributed-operation rows. RRFlow keeps the one-project/one-estate alpha topology and rejects SurrealDB product and tenancy vocabulary. |
| Persistence, transactions, and lifecycle | Preserved in storage abstraction, ordered key grammar, multi-model commit, isolation, physical fan-out, concurrent index lifecycle, and operations/recovery rows; acceptance remains C and J evidence. |
| Native data models | Preserved as the native-model-families row and the RRFlow multi-model object contract. Each accepted model must become typed engine state rather than a JSON compatibility envelope. |
| Schema | Preserved in schema-and-stored-behavior, scalar/unique-index, and authorization rows. Functions and automation remain subordinate to the schema and engine transaction authorities. |
| Query | Preserved across query languages, planning, native access paths, and analytical execution. rrflowQL and the typed public operation catalogue remain the only RRFlow owners. |
| Indexing | Split into graph adjacency, scalar/unique, BM25/vector, index lifecycle, planner, and Qdrant-reference rows so no umbrella index claim can hide missing transaction or exactness proof. |
| Realtime | Preserved as committed live impact plus separately durable change history, subscription ACK/lease/backpressure state, and policy-gated automation. |
| Security | Preserved in the security/capabilities row and security authority documentation; enforcement spans candidate production through delivery rather than residing in an adapter. |
| APIs | Preserved in the RPC/SDK/MCP row and generic public contract; outward surfaces cannot create another engine or context authority. |
| Extensions | Split into schema/stored behavior and extensions/model execution. Functions, inference providers, object activity, generators, triggers, routines, and skills require closed typed contracts and explicit gates. |
| Operations, observability, UI, and estates | Split into operations/recovery, interactive UI, installation/readiness, and topology. Connectome stays a separate client repository; operational evidence stays engine-correlated. |
| Distributed operation | Preserved only as a future failure/evidence input. RRFlow 1.0 alpha remains single-node and makes no distributed claim. |
| SurrealDB 3.3 preview | Preserved only as a pinned watchpoint; it cannot change the stable baseline or authorize implementation work. |

## Canonical RRFlow flow informed by this research

SurrealDB contributes implementation patterns and failure cases to this flow;
it does not add another runtime component.

```

The fast and analytical paths share identity, schema, authorization, stamp,
budget, and evidence. `rrflowMX` may keep equivalent typed structures in
process; `rrflowKV` additionally owns WAL durability, MVCC, manifests,
immutable pages, compaction, crash recovery, and reopen. DataFusion computes
over borrowed or explicitly accounted Arrow buffers. It never commits state.

## Current RRFlow implementation facts

These facts came from complete reads of the current storage transaction,
rrflowKV, keyspace, query execution, DataFusion, index, live-query,
subscription, and MCP authority files. They constrain later work but do not
change a roadmap checkbox.

| Current evidence | Consequence still owned by the roadmap |
|---|---|
| `RrflowKvStore` opens an authenticated rrflowKV application format over the custom `rrd-lsm` database, persists WAL batches, validates read stamps, tracks an authenticated runtime log accumulator, and has crash/storage-full tests around WAL publication. | This is a substantive durable substrate. C still must freeze the final key/page format, narrow the storage port, remove prior-format success, and prove complete semantic parity and reopen. |
| One runtime commit writes canonical latest values, the hash-chained change log, projection work, audit, accumulator state, and outcome in one rrflowKV batch. | Relations are keyed only by relation identity; scalar/BM25/vector access structures and reasoning state are not yet an effect-complete native transaction family. C/E/G must add them without splitting authority. |
| Most runtime values, catalogues, changes, index artifacts, and control state are encoded as JSON values; the segment format is row-record oriented. | C-01/C-06 must define RRFlow binary keys and Arrow-compatible column pages, explicit buffer leases, deltas, compaction, and deterministic decoding. “Arrow-native” is a target, not a current claim. |
| `StorageEngine` currently combines claims, control records, catalogues, runtime data, snapshots, projections, archives, and evidence; catalogue transitions can commit separately from runtime data. | A-07/C-02 must split narrow physical/transactional ports while keeping one `RrdEngine` coordinator and one effect-complete commit receipt. |
| Query execution validates a stamp and uses DataFusion 55 with memory, spill, elapsed-time, batch, row, scan, and output bounds. | DataFusion is real and embedded, but F is not accepted until the provider streams stamped rrflowKV pages and accounts for decode/copy/allocation/backpressure across the full plan. |
| Current `execute` reconstructs rows from runtime changes, converts a complete `Vec<QueryRow>` into Arrow batches, then feeds a `MemorySourceConfig`; filter pushdown is declared unsupported. | C-04/F-01/F-02 replace cursor-zero replay and eager materialization with direct native reads, pinned partition streams, and measured projection/filter/limit pushdown. |
| Graph traversal builds `RuntimeGraphSnapshot` and scans reconstructed relations breadth-first. | E-01 must use atomic outgoing/incoming adjacency range scans, temporal overlay rules, exact structural oracles, bounded traversal, and reopen evidence. |
| Scalar/count/geo/materialized/BM25 index catalogues and immutable JSON artifacts exist; full builds execute the source query, and “incremental reconciliation” compares complete old/new row maps. | E-02/E-03/C-07 replace snapshot artifacts as the primary path with transactionally maintained native entries and bounded resumable generation work. Existing behavior remains an oracle until replacement evidence passes. |
| Unique-index validation currently replays all changes at the transaction read stamp; catalogue publication is a control transition separate from ordinary runtime commit. | C-02/E-02 must bind uniqueness and ready-generation publication to the correct transaction/range-conflict semantics with no race or second catalogue authority. |
| Live query polling executes a query at the prior cursor and again at the captured head, then diffs full row maps. Durable subscription state adds ownership, leases, ACKs, replay windows, and backpressure through control records. | Preserve the useful subscription safety semantics, but H-03 must consume commit impacts/durable cursor pages and persist state through the final typed engine model instead of polling two complete snapshots. |
| The MCP adapter can use an exclusive embedded engine or authenticated daemon client and calls the engine context operation. | Keep the thin-adapter shape; D/H/J still must prove installed configuration, provider-neutral endpoint resolution, complete authorization, bounded streaming, restart, and the same engine behavior across all outward surfaces. |

## Gate-by-gate convergence and proof

This table prevents later packages from converting upstream feature names or
passing tests into false completion claims.

| Gate package | Required authored result | Proof that can close it |
|---|---|---|
| C-01 | One frozen RRFlow key grammar and segment/page identity covering records, temporal relations, both adjacency directions, scalar/BM25/vector entries, reasoning state, audit, outbox, and manifests. | Golden byte ordering/prefix/malformed-key corpus plus direct removal of every successful prior-format writer/reader. |
| C-02 | A narrow `RrdEngine` transaction port compiles the complete authorized logical effect set into bounded physical mutations and returns one certainty-bearing receipt. | Conflict/range/fan-out/idempotency/lost-ack/fault injection at every write boundary proves all-or-none semantic effects. |
| C-03 | The exact same semantic operations and error classes run against rrflowMX and rrflowKV. | Shared randomized/model-based differential corpus; rrflowKV additionally survives process kill, torn tail, storage full, reopen, and compaction. |
| C-04 | Direct stamped point/range/family readers replace history reconstruction on normal paths. | Scan/decode/copy counters and adversarial corpus prove result equivalence while work follows selected keys/pages rather than total history. |
| C-06/C-07 | Immutable Arrow-compatible pages, delta/compaction policy, leases, cache accounting, backpressure, and bounded maintenance. | Zero-copy eligibility is demonstrated from buffer addresses/lifetimes; every fallback allocation is counted; pressure, cancellation, corruption, compaction, and long-run RSS tests retain failures. |
| E-01/E-02 | Atomic temporal adjacency and scalar/compound/unique entries with exact direct readers. | Structural and transaction differential against simple exact oracles, including deletes, retirements, self-loops, duplicates, temporal windows, conflicts, rebuild, and reopen. |
| E-03/E-04 | Incremental BM25 and vector/HNSW projection paths with exact lexical/vector oracles and deterministic rerank. | Mutation/restart/corruption/filter/recall/ranking/resource corpus at one stamp; see the pinned Qdrant reference for vector-specific inputs. |
| E-05/F | One costed physical planner composes native readers with streaming rrflowQL/DataFusion operators under one authorization and budget. | Plan-selection, security-pushdown, result differential, cancellation, spill, scan, memory, allocation, cache, concurrency, and historical-stamp evidence. |
| G/H | Persisted reasoning trees select bounded engine work; context/evidence/feedback and live impacts survive reopen. | Real task corpus proves selected/skipped routes, same-stamp evidence, CAS advancement, denied invalid proposals, feedback adaptation, token/resource effects, restart, and no hidden client lifecycle. |
| D/J | A closed-by-default bundle installs, configures, attunes, authenticates, opens, closes, and reopens one per-project RRFlow estate. | Clean-machine and existing-project installation matrices prove preview/apply/uninstall, secret handling, resumability, readiness, persistent semantic readback, outward conformance, and measured footprint. |

## Adaptation protocol

Before using any SurrealDB implementation detail, the assigned RRFlow package
must journal all of the following:

1. the exact SurrealDB tag, commit, file, symbol, and relevant test, issue, or
   release failure;
2. the bounded behavior, invariant, layout property, algorithm, or adversarial
   condition being studied;
3. the RRFlow semantic family, canonical destination, transaction boundary,
   binary key/page or projection identity, Arrow schema, budget, and owning
   roadmap gate;
4. rejected assumptions, including namespace/database/table authority,
   SurrealQL/GQL/GraphQL or RPC compatibility, general JSON physical form,
   backend selection, snapshot-isolation overclaim, migration reader,
   background-worker authority, edition/Cloud topology, and adapter-owned
   state;
5. an independent exact oracle and the required semantic, fault, corruption,
   pressure, cancellation, security, resource, compaction, crash, and reopen
   corpus;
6. provenance retained in code comments/evidence without adopting a
   SurrealDB namespace, exported contract, or on-disk shape; and
7. deletion of temporary experimental or comparison paths before commit.

A copied module that compiles is not accepted. A translated behavior is
accepted only when the RRFlow-owned semantic, transaction, resource, security,
and reopen evidence named by its gate passes through the one engine boundary.

## Comparative-evidence contract

RRFlow currently makes no ease, performance, durability, correctness, or
feature-superiority claim against SurrealDB. Gate J-04 may support a bounded
claim only with a like-for-like comparison that records:

- exact SurrealDB tag, commit/image/binary digest, edition, configuration,
  capabilities, storage backend, query surface, and client/harness revisions;
- exact RRFlow revision, release manifest, storage profile, configuration,
  key/page format, and enabled native/DataFusion operators;
- hardware, kernel, filesystem, mount options, storage medium, memory limits,
  CPU affinity, accelerators, toolchains, and dependency closure;
- corpus and digest, data model, schema/index definitions, temporal/history
  distribution, query/mutation mix, concurrency, warmup, and duration;
- result/transaction agreement, graph/index/vector recall, tail latency,
  throughput, failures, CPU, page faults, RSS, cache residency, I/O, write
  amplification, logical/apparent/allocated bytes, and context/token output;
- conflict/fan-out behavior, update visibility, crash points, WAL recovery,
  corruption, snapshot/reopen, compaction, rebuild, subscription replay, and
  long-duration resource drift; and
- clean installation bytes, commands, elapsed time, processes/services,
  ports, configuration, secrets, authenticated readiness, attunement, and
  persistent semantic readback.

Unlike semantics, omitted failures, warm-vs-cold comparisons, unpinned inputs,
or a benchmark that bypasses either product's normal authority cannot support
a claim.

### Rejected local claim diagnostic and retained corrections

KB-05 removed the 2026-08-23 RRFlow/SurrealDB claim diagnostic, its Python
driver, its stored ratio artifact, and the Rust test that asserted those
ratios. They were superseded pre-release residue, not J-04 evidence. The
review retained the useful failure lessons here instead of moving an
unqualified result into an evidence archive.

| Defect in the removed diagnostic | Direct evidence | Required J-04 correction |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline identity was incomplete and stale. | SurrealDB `3.0.5` and its local binary digest were recorded, but the canonical reference is `3.2.4`; the RRFlow revision, binary digest, build profile, dependency closure, and release manifest were absent. | Pin both source revisions and all executed artifact/image digests. Build or acquire them through the manifest-recorded commands and retain their complete closures. |
| The purported reproducer no longer executed. | It defaulted to a host-specific Cargo cache and invoked the current benchmark as `--child native --path …`; the current child contract is `--child --path …`. A fresh current build exited before its first trial. | Resolve only manifest-declared repository or release-bundle artifacts, validate the harness/binary handshake before timing, and fail the evidence run when any declared cell executes zero trials. |
| The semantic corpus and verification were not equal. | SurrealDB and RRFlow used different session values. SurrealDB verification checked every projected field, while the RRFlow verifier checked sequence, cardinality, and `object` only. The run did not inject conflicts or batch failures. | Generate one content-addressed typed corpus, lower it explicitly for each system, verify every field, identity, order, result, transaction outcome, and post-reopen value against an independent oracle, and retain failure cells. |
| Measurement layers were conflated. | Direct embedded RRFlow calls were compared with SurrealDB HTTP/SQL; SurrealDB server-reported statement time had no equivalent RRFlow phase. “Readiness” compared an authenticated server/namespace/database exchange with opening a storage object. | Report separate like-for-like kernel/storage, public-protocol, and clean-deployment cells. Every timer declares its boundaries, included processes, serialization, authentication, planning, and durability work; unlike cells are never divided into a competitive ratio. |
| Resource and lifecycle accounting was asymmetric. | Process inclusion differed, fixed CPU/memory/filesystem controls were absent, and the primary disk ratio compared different unmaintained states without an equivalent maintenance boundary. | Run both systems in equivalent constrained process/container envelopes and report logical, apparent, allocated, resident, cache, WAL, segment, snapshot, I/O, and maintenance phases independently before and after clean reopen. |
| Statistical and workload coverage was diagnostic only. | Three small alternating trials had no recorded warm-up, frequency/governor state, background-load control, concurrency matrix, confidence treatment, long-duration drift, or graph/BM25/vector/DataFusion/context workload. | Predeclare warm-up, order/randomization, repetitions, concurrency, duration, outlier and interval treatment, workload digests, mixed-family interference, recall/quality thresholds, and failure retention before execution. |
| The test proved stored direction, not reproducibility. | The Rust test parsed the checked-in JSON and asserted that selected ratios were above or below one; it never executed the harness, recomputed results from raw samples, or verified provenance. | Evidence verification validates schema/provenance, recomputes aggregates from immutable raw trials, rejects missing/failed cells, and never requires RRFlow to win. Reproduction is a separate commanded run against the pinned manifest. |

Alternating isolated trials, clean reopen, bounded paged verification, exact
artifact digests, and separate logical/apparent/allocated-byte accounting
remain useful inputs. They must be implemented once in the planned
`scripts/release/compare_deployment.py` and
`fixtures/release/deployment-baselines-v1.toml` J-04 package after its C
through J-03 prerequisites pass. No active benchmark implementation or RRFlow
performance claim survives this review.

The research stopped after every consequential stable capability family and
failure case had a first-party or commit-pinned source, every retained pattern
had one RRFlow owner and proof gate, and incompatible authority assumptions
were explicit. Further SurrealDB feature enumeration would not change the
immediate dependency order: finish canonical storage and transactions, add
native access paths, stream stamped Arrow pages through rrflowQL/DataFusion,
then persist reasoning/context feedback and qualify installation and delivery.
