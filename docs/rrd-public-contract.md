# RRD public contract v1

Status: supporting wire-contract record. `README.md` remains the sole product
architecture, current-status, and roadmap authority.

`rrd-contract` is the public transport-neutral boundary. It does not
depend on RRFlow storage, query, cluster, node, or Connectome implementation.

Version 1 freezes:

- the `rrd` protocol identity and exact protocol-version negotiation;
- canonical URL/path-safe resource identities for organisation, estate,
  project, instance, node, shard, collection, table, record, transaction,
  snapshot, backup, and operation resources;
- explicit hierarchical resource paths with no cwd/session inference;
- request, operation, idempotency, and deadline coordinates;
- a mutation rule requiring an idempotency key;
- content binding of an idempotency key to a lowercase SHA-256 operation
  digest;
- deployment modes and sorted, versioned capability negotiation;
- success/error response framing and stable error codes.

The v1 deployment vocabulary is `memory`, `embedded`, `local_daemon`, `edge`,
`remote`, and `distributed`. These names describe one engine's composition or
transport face, not separate products. The checked-in
[`rrd-deployment-conformance-v1.json`](../fixtures/rrd-deployment-conformance-v1.json)
and its strict public `DeploymentConformanceCorpus` schema provide the shared
logical fixture. Current qualification and intentionally open modes are
recorded in [`rrd-deployment-modes-v1.md`](rrd-deployment-modes-v1.md).

F2 extends version 1 additively with bounded transport-session leases,
transaction leases and terminal states, typed multi-model mutations and commit
receipts, and the first read-only query contract. The mutation vocabulary
covers claims, schema registries, records/documents, graph relations, events,
dense/sparse/multi-dense vectors with embedding provenance, time-series
samples, WGS84 geo values, and pre-staged immutable object references.
`ExecuteQuery` defines strict query, parameter, scan, row, batch, and
encoded-output bounds; its typed result carries the canonical query, read
coordinates, plan evidence, execution counters, and rows. These types remain
independent of `rrd_core`; the server performs an explicit lowering into the
authoritative runtime rather than serializing private runtime structs.
`QueryPlanSnapshot.security_policy_revision` and `authorization_sha256` bind
public execution evidence to the exact compiled authorization. Revision zero
is reserved for the explicitly unsecured loopback development mode; secured
queries inject tenant/row filters and allowed-field projection before this plan
is produced.

Transaction preview is a durable prepare, not a read disguised as a write. Its
mutation envelope requires idempotency, binds the pending write-set digest and
stable runtime time, and returns a complete prospective `DataSnapshot` reduced
from the exact read stamp plus the pending mutations. The prospective cursor is
explicitly non-authoritative until commit; replay, timeout, abort, commit, and
payload/key collision semantics persist across engine and server restart.

The vector boundary now includes journaled collection administration. A named
vector definition freezes its stored field, dense/sparse/multi-dense kind,
dimensions, metric, optional embedding-model digest, and requested
pinned/cached/cold placement. Ensure is mutation-idempotent; list exposes the
authoritative catalogue revision and stable collection generation. Search may
use the original field/metric address for compatibility or a collection plus
vector name; the latter resolves the persisted contract and rejects kind or
dimension drift before executing. `put_vector` mutations may carry the same
collection/vector coordinates; the server validates their field, kind,
dimensions, and required model provenance before committing them with all
other record/graph/series/geo mutations and their payload properties.
Search also accepts a depth/node-bounded typed payload filter covering equality,
inequality, membership, range, existence, and recursive all/any/not. The filter
is a canonical OpenAPI component so recursive generated SDK types do not depend
on request-local schema definitions.

The first vector-read contract supports bounded dense, sparse, and
multi-dense/MaxSim queries across cosine, dot, Euclidean, and Manhattan
metrics. Its result carries the authoritative read manifest/cursor, scan count,
plan digest, selected access path and exactness alongside typed scored hits.

The retained changefeed contract is cursor-addressed and page bounded. It
freezes lifecycle coordinates and the runtime digest chain, preserves complete
claim provenance, and reuses the typed public multi-model vocabulary for every
non-claim mutation. `through_cursor`, rather than the final matching change,
is the sole resume coordinate so scoped feeds cannot stall on unrelated global
activity.

The bounded follow contract remains a maximum five-second compatibility path.
Durable subscriptions persist an immutable changefeed or live-query definition,
owner session, acknowledged cursor, lease, retention floor, connection
generation, and bounded outstanding-delivery window in the engine control
journal. WebSocket reconnect replays from the durable ACK; transport state
never becomes a second ordering authority.

Managed backup/restore is path-closed at the public boundary. A create request
contains only a bounded safe label and event time; a restore request contains a
content-addressed backup digest, canonical restore identity, and event time.
Catalogue responses expose authenticated archive identity, watermarks and an
explicit coverage matrix. No request accepts a source, catalogue, target, or
active-instance filesystem path. The server owns generated locations and a
restore always targets a new root.

The F4 audit vocabulary freezes a closed security-action enum, authorization
and completion phases, allow/deny/fail decisions, and bounded cursor-addressed
read/export requests. Public records contain principal/action/resource and
request/operation coordinates, request/response SHA-256 values, previous audit
digest, and semantic record digest; bodies, credentials, bearer tokens, and
arbitrary headers are excluded. Pages carry their chain anchor/head and global
`through_sequence`, so readers validate lineage and advance safely across
unrelated control transitions. Export returns canonical JSON Lines with an
exact media type, count, content digest, and the same chain coordinates.

F5 begins from `EndpointCatalogue`, not handwritten per-language route lists.
It currently freezes 34 sorted HTTP operation identities plus the authenticated
subscription WebSocket descriptor, with method/path template, authentication
mode, mutation/idempotency classification, fixed or descriptor-derived
security action, and public request/response/frame type names.
`GET /v1/schema/endpoints` serves the exact
catalogue used by the server. Duplicate operations/routes, GET mutations,
private Rust paths, invalid names, and ordering drift fail contract tests.
The first consumer is `rrd-client`; it imports these public types directly and
has no dependency on storage, query, server, estate, or security implementation
crates in its release dependency graph.

Every public wire type also derives JSON Schema. `openapi_document()` projects
those schemas and the endpoint catalogue into deterministic OpenAPI 3.1, and
`rrd-contract-export` writes the same document to standard output for package
generation. Its canonical pretty-JSON SHA-256 is frozen in the contract tests;
intentional schema drift therefore requires an explicit version review. A
running RRD serves the document from `GET /v1/schema/openapi`.
Self-recursive `QueryValue` is promoted to one canonical OpenAPI component;
other definitions are inlined, so references resolve under ordinary OpenAPI
generators rather than relying on schema-local `$defs` resolution.

The frozen JSON fixture is
[`public-contract-v1.json`](../crates/transport/rrd-contract/fixtures/public-contract-v1.json).
Malformed identifiers, duplicate/unsorted capabilities, unsupported protocol
versions, unknown fields, repeated resource kinds, and mutations without an
idempotency key fail closed in tests.

`rrd-server` binds the contract to a loopback local-daemon face and an
experimental TLS 1.3 mutual-authentication remote face. The latter is tested
but remains pre-release deployment evidence, not distributed or managed-cloud
qualification. Generated SDKs must preserve these same bytes and mode names.
