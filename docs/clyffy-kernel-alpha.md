# RRFlow alpha → Clyffy kernel handoff

Status: historical execution contract aligned to the RRFlow `0.1.0` alpha identity.
Current product boundaries and gates are authoritative only in [`README.md`](../README.md).
This document remains release-gated rather than calendar-gated.

## Product boundary

The canonical product is **RRFlow**:

- RRO composes Automaton's provider/session brokerage with LFG's just-in-time
  context encoding and routing.
- RRFlow means Reason Ready Flow and is the single product. RRD, the Reason
  Ready Daemon, is its one native engine/runtime: persistence, transactions,
  catalogue, query, indexes, reasoning, lifecycle, security, audit, and
  recovery compose there.
- RRD LSM/MVCC code is the native persistence implementation, not a separate
  product boundary. RRD is the actual Fjall competitor; Fjall
  remains only a compatibility reader and differential oracle. Arrow/DataFusion
  is target architecture and must not be implied by the current bespoke row
  executor.
- Connectome Panel records, explains, visualizes, and controls those contracts.
- PostgreSQL/pgvector is project-scoped shared operator knowledge behind the
  external adapter; it is neither RRFlow's canonical persistence nor LFG's JIT
  compiler.
- Clyffy will package RRFlow into installable project and estate deployments.
  It consumes versioned RRFlow/RRD interfaces; it does not fork RRD internals
  into a second implementation.

The Clyffy repository should not be created by pooling old repositories. It
starts from a release manifest that pins reviewed versions of Automaton, LFG,
Connectome/RRFlow, provider adapters, schemas, migrations, and benchmark evidence.

## Canonical lifecycle event model

Every enforceable workflow event uses a stable identity:

```text
<domain>:<producer>:<action>[:<target>]
```

The first implemented family is package execution:

```text
package:bun:test
package:pnpm:run:typecheck
package:npm:run:test-unit
package:yarn:run:build
```

Script identity is preserved so unrelated runs cannot supersede one another.
The local alpha now implements this enforcement sequence:

1. A project-owned workflow manifest declares event, command matcher, required
   scope, required projections, freshness bounds, and verification policy.
2. Session start captures an instance-bound `ReadStamp` and injects only the
   allowed context budget.
3. Pre-tool policy resolves the declared event and denies on missing identity,
   stale source/projection generations, absent authorization, or an unresolved
   prior mutation.
4. Post-tool handling commits the observable command/result envelope and audit
   event atomically, then schedules rebuildable projections.
5. Stop/compact gates require the reasoning-run contract to reach a verified
   outcome or preserve an explicit incomplete state for the next session.

No package-manager hook may infer business meaning from a script name. The
project manifest supplies that meaning and is versioned evidence itself.
The frozen manifest, observation envelope, denial matrix, and three-backend
differential are documented in `docs/package-workflows.md`.

## Alpha release gates

RRFlow becomes a firm local alpha only when all of these are machine-verifiable:

| Gate | Required evidence |
|---|---|
| Portable contract | Versioned golden JSON for read, transaction, plan, projection, audit, workflow event, and error envelopes |
| Transaction semantics | Reference/compatibility/native differential, conflict matrix, read-your-writes, repeatable paging, crash/restart, lease and retention-pin tests |
| Query/runtime | `RRFlowQL` parser corpus and fuzzing; typed-SDK equivalence; deterministic `RRD query executor` plans and budgets |
| Native storage | WAL/MVCC/manifest crash matrix, compaction with pinned snapshots, corruption handling, recovery idempotency, and no acknowledged-write loss |
| Unified data | Atomic record/edge/claim/event/vector/series/geo/blob-reference mutations plus local/S3 object differential |
| Search | Exact dense/sparse/multivector oracle; ANN recall/latency/memory matrix; filtered update/delete/reopen/compaction soak |
| Lifecycle | Claude hooks and MCP/daemon runtimes produce the same decisions and audit fields; package workflow policies deny stale or unverified mutations |
| Workbench | Freeze/rewind/forward renders only persisted events and links every value to cursor, snapshot, manifest, plan, and projection generation |
| Runtime tracing | Start/annotation/finish events correlate reasoning, query, plan, storage, projection, model/tool, cluster, and adapter work; incomplete spans survive crash and export obeys data-class retention |
| Operator knowledge | A project-scoped pgvector adapter proves exact/filtered-ANN parity, model/revision freshness, tenant denial, and idempotent outbox retry without claiming cross-store ACID |
| Release | Reproducible artifacts, signed update manifest, forward/rollback migration rehearsal, SBOM/provenance, compatibility matrix, and benchmark regression budgets |

Cluster/Multi-AZ is a separate deployment gate. A local alpha must not claim
distributed durability merely because its interfaces reserve shard fields.

## Deployment tiers for the future Clyffy repository

| Tier | Shape | Update behavior |
|---|---|---|
| Developer | One embedded instance per project and environment | Opt-in stable/beta channel, signed manifest, local migration backup and health rollback |
| Workstation | `rrflow-mcp` owns multiple isolated instances and provider adapters | Staged daemon restart, schema compatibility check, per-instance rollback |
| Team | Authenticated service with explicit tenant/shard placement and object storage | Rolling update only after mixed-version simulation and migration fencing |
| Edge | Offline, resource-capped exact/ANN search with no required network | Side-loaded signed bundle and atomic slot switch |

Provider adapters use official local/API authentication and expose capability,
effort, quota, and observability metadata. Clyffy may combine subscription AI
services at the orchestration layer, but it must not pool credentials, pretend
provider-specific effort levels are equivalent, or label inferred hidden
reasoning as observed data.

## Competitive proof, not a blanket claim

“Beats SurrealDB” and “beats Qdrant” are two separate benchmark hypotheses.
They become publishable only after the corresponding RRFlow subsystem exists.

- Against SurrealDB: fixed hardware and durability; transactional mixed
  record/edge/time queries; conflict rate; p50/p95/p99 latency; throughput;
  recovery time; write amplification; RSS/disk; and correctness oracle.
- Against Qdrant: exact oracle first; dense/sparse/multivector and filtered ANN;
  recall@k/NDCG; p50/p95/p99 latency; build/update/delete/reopen/compaction;
  CPU/GPU build cost; RSS/VRAM/disk; and stale-generation behavior.
- RRFlow-specific frontier-runtime value is measured separately: task success,
  stale-action denials, retries/regressions, provider/context/reasoning tokens,
  latency, compaction recovery, and trace completeness.

Results must publish dataset/version, query generation, warmup, concurrency,
hardware/software, durability, configuration, raw samples, confidence interval,
and failed runs. Until then the repository may claim implemented semantics and
measured local results, never universal superiority.

## Immediate execution order

1. **Complete:** exact `RRFlowQL`/`RRD query executor` over the frozen M0/M1 port and live
   snapshot/retention-pin inspection in Connectome.
2. **Complete:** atomic hash-chained audit/runtime commits and deny-by-default
   reasoning/lifecycle differentials.
3. **Local gate passed:** native `RRD LSM` behind the same semantic, query,
   crash, storage-full, compaction, and benchmark harness. Its 20,000-operation
   mixed physical mutation differential and resumable/rollback-safe 18-keyspace
   migration rehearsal pass locally. Reproduce the strict Fjall performance
   matrix remotely before retiring the compatibility oracle. New
   CLI/MCP/workbench stores select native; existing non-native directories move
   only through `rrflow storage migrate`.
4. **Complete at the local M4 gate:** unified vector/series/geo/object
   mutations, verified content-addressed publication, atomic outbox/audit, and
   idempotent retry. Live S3 endpoint certification remains deployment evidence.
5. **Complete at the local M5 gate:** exact dense/sparse/multivector truth,
   filter-aware dense HNSW with exact reranking, projection lifecycle, and a
   retained recall/latency/memory/update/delete/reopen baseline. The subsequent
   G04-W04 engine slice adds scalar/product/binary/TurboQuant lifecycle,
   checksummed mmap, and SIMD/scalar evidence. Compact HNSW, GPU, and external
   Qdrant proof remain open.
6. **Complete at the local M6 kernel gate:** provenance/CAS-bound embedding
   jobs, exact model-space binding, compact dense mmap, scalar/AVX2 parity,
   verified accelerator/fallback policy, local FastEmbed adapter, and offline
   edge budgets. Physical-GPU and real-model quality evidence remain required
   before competitive vector claims.
7. **M7 protocol and first real-consensus gate complete:** canonical placement,
   consistency, snapshot-vector, route, transfer, and reshard contracts;
   deterministic single-term fault simulation; and a feature-gated OpenRaft
   adapter over native RRD LSM with storage conformance and real four-node
   election/failover/snapshot/membership evidence. Typed canonical
   `RuntimeCommit` application now shares one WAL frame with Raft state and is
   reopened identically across three voters. Adapter v4 separates local Raft
   history from canonical state and uses physical RRD LSM snapshot-bundle v1 to
   catch up a fresh learner after log purge with the runtime truth intact. It
   also makes placement epochs explicit/membership-bound, invalidates stale
   bindings after Raft voter identity/zone changes, and deterministically bounds
   request retention.
   An opt-in TLS 1.3/mTLS OpenRaft transport now binds canonical workload
   identity and bounded RPC envelopes and passes real loopback replication plus
   post-purge snapshot catch-up. A real node executable and versioned local
   supervisor contract additionally pass four-process crash/restart, live
   partition failover, reconciliation, post-purge snapshot catch-up, identity
   denial, hot credential replacement/revocation, stale-leaf restart denial,
   and corrupt-pointer restart denial on one host. A real-TCP matrix also passes
   two-root overlap and old-root retirement. Snapshot build/receive/install and
   local object publication are now file-backed, hard-capped, crash-cleaned,
   and regression-gated against whole-bundle RSS growth. Project-scoped vector
   artifacts now cross the real mTLS/process learner path through durable
   resumable sessions before activation; the target independently verifies the
   snapshot's complete object closure. Typed fail-closed transfer observations
   now route bounded causal trace commits through the current Raft leader and
   prove identical voter/learner trace state after purge and failover. Receiver
   admission, durable inventory reconstruction, stale-session/receipt GC, and
   distinct-session concurrency are bounded and tested. Identity-scoped/global
   transport admission, bounded Raft timing, and reset-explicit transport,
   artifact-session, and consensus-trace telemetry now ship through project
   node status.
   Independent-host and hardware chaos, larger retained closure workloads,
   automatic SPIFFE issuance/streaming, durable supervisor generation,
   automatic telemetry collection/export and Multi-AZ evidence remain open;
   Connectome now retains and replays explicitly submitted control-v4 status.
8. **Local gate complete:** declared package workflows now bind preflight,
   pre-tool freshness/authorization, and post-tool atomic evidence across the
   shared hook/MCP handler. A durable cross-process authorization lease remains
   part of the distributed-coordinator gate, not this local claim.
9. **Temporal workbench slice complete:** Connectome projects the bounded global
   persisted mutation stream into reasoning, routing, workflow, model/flight,
   search, and storage/data lanes. Freeze, scrub, rewind, forward, and inspection
   retain the exact cursor, scope, mutation digest, full mutation, and available
   hash-chained audit envelope. Query/storage, projection/vector, and embedding
   runtime spans now feed those lanes with three-engine and native-reopen proof.
   Causal lifecycle reconstruction, integrity diagnostics, a non-summed
   measured critical candidate, control-only default JSON export, and
   provider/tool-envelope spans are now complete for the local workbench.
   Cluster spans, cursor-delta transport, OTLP translation, cross-run resource
   analysis, and controlled provider evaluations remain open.
10. **Portable and first live operator-knowledge gates complete:** versioned project/member,
    source/relation/tenant, model, snapshot/revision, path/control, result, and
    idempotent outbox contracts now have an exact reference adapter, safe
    pgvector SQL plan, durable search/sync spans, three-engine denial/privacy
    proof, native reopen, and Connectome visibility. The opt-in live transport
    adds repeatable-read snapshot/catalog evidence, atomic revision/idempotency
    controls, typed upsert/delete, ordered exact/HNSW/IVFFlat endpoint parity,
    and reconnect proof in CI. Payload filters, certificate-backed TLS endpoint,
    process restart/concurrency failure injection, and retained performance
    evidence remain required before the pgvector row can be fully promoted.
11. Cut the RRFlow alpha manifest; only then scaffold the separate Clyffy master
   repository and its signed tier/update system.
