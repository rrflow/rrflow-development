# Qdrant capability inventory and RRFlow disposition

Status: supporting point-in-time research inventory, not current RRFlow status
or roadmap. `README.md` is authoritative when a disposition has changed.

**Baseline:** Qdrant `1.19.x`, the current documentation/API line on
2026-08-23. This inventory follows the SurrealDB inventory intentionally:
first the general database/runtime stack, then the specialist vector stack.
Individual endpoint fields are grouped into product capability families, but
no major data, search, persistence, security, SDK, operations, edge, inference,
distributed, or estate surface is intentionally omitted.

Status terms have the same strict meaning as
[`surrealdb-capability-inventory.md`](surrealdb-capability-inventory.md):
**Verified**, **Partial**, **Absent**, and **External**.

## 1. Product form and deployment

| Community Helm deployment | **Absent** |
| Managed Cloud clusters | **Absent** |
| Hybrid Cloud on customer Kubernetes with cloud management | **Absent** |
| Fully disconnected Private Cloud operator | **Absent** |

| Consistent data API across self-hosted and cloud | **Absent** |
| AWS, GCP, Azure and customer-infrastructure placement | **Absent** |

## 2. Data model and collection lifecycle

Sources: [manage data](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/manage-data/),
[collections](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/manage-data/collections/),
[points](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/manage-data/points/), and
[payload](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/concepts/payload/).

| Qdrant capability | RRFlow disposition |
|---|---|
| Collections as independently configured sets of points | **Verified in the engine** — revisioned named-vector and payload-index metadata over the shared point transaction log |
| Collection create, inspect, update, delete and list | **Engine operations verified**; generated HTTP/MCP/CLI/SDK bindings remain G06 |
| Atomic collection aliases for migrations/blue-green cutover | **Absent** |
| Points identified by 64-bit integer or UUID | **Partial** — typed runtime references, different identity contract |
| Point upsert, retrieve, delete, count and existence APIs | **Partial** — atomic batch upsert/retirement plus retrieve/scroll exist; count/existence and generated bindings remain |
| Batch and column-oriented point upload | **Partial** — atomic row-oriented batches, no optimized columnar ingestion contract |
| Point vector update/delete independent of payload | **Verified in the engine** through versioned put/retire mutations |
| Payload set/overwrite/delete/clear independent of vector | **Absent** public point operation |
| Arbitrary JSON payload objects and arrays | **Partial** — typed runtime properties are narrower |

| Multivectors with variable row count | **Verified locally** for exact storage/search |
| ColBERT-style MaxSim comparator | **Verified locally** for exact oracle |
| Vector datatypes such as float32, float16 and uint8 | **Partial** — authoritative f32 only; quantized artifacts do not change the point datatype |
| Cosine, dot, Euclidean and Manhattan metrics | **Verified locally** |
| Collection-specific WAL, optimizer, shard, strict-mode and quantization configuration | **Absent** public administration |
| Approximate point/vector counts and detailed collection status | **Absent** public service |

## 3. Query and exploration API

Sources: [similarity search](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/search/search/),
[exploration](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/search/explore/), and
[hybrid/multi-stage queries](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/search/hybrid-queries/).

| Qdrant capability | RRFlow disposition |
|---|---|
| Unified Query API | **Verified in the engine, absent as a public API** — one bounded recursive `ExecuteRetrievalQuery` contract owns sources, prefetch, fusion, reranking, and result shapes; generated bindings remain G06 |
| Nearest-neighbor search by raw vector | **Verified locally** |
| Search by an existing point ID/vector | **Partial** — stored vector references are exact recommendation/discovery/context examples, but nearest-by-ID is not a dedicated operator |
| Exact full-scan search | **Verified locally** |
| Approximate HNSW search with query-time `ef` | **Verified locally** for dense vectors |
| `indexed_only` eventual/partial-result option | **Absent** |
| Score threshold, limit, offset and result vector/payload selectors | **Partial** — bounded limit/candidate limit and named-vector evidence exist; threshold, offset, and arbitrary selectors do not |
| Positive/negative-example recommendation queries | **Verified in the engine** for raw or exact stored vector references |
| Average-vector and best-score recommendation strategies | **Verified in the engine** for dense, sparse, and multi-dense values with strict shape checks |

| Context-only search that partitions vector space | **Verified in the engine** with deterministic zone/margin scoring |
| Scroll through all filtered points | **Verified in the engine** — deterministic point-reference pages at one read stamp |
| Order results by payload field | **Absent** vector API |
| Group search results by payload value | **Verified in the engine** over a bounded candidate universe and an active typed payload index |
| Cross-collection lookup for group/detail enrichment | **Absent** |
| Random sampling | **Absent** |
| Facet counts over payload values | **Verified in the engine** over a bounded candidate universe and an active typed payload index |

| Batch query endpoint | **Absent** |
| Nested prefetch queries | **Verified in the engine** with depth, node, branch, candidate, and total-work bounds |

| Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) | **Verified in the engine** with one bounded fixed-point weight per branch |
| Distribution-Based Score Fusion (DBSF) | **Absent** |
| Formula queries combining scores, payload conditions and numeric/geo boosts | **Partial** — governed payload-conditioned fixed-point add/multiply exists; a general arithmetic/geo formula language does not |
| Dense+sparse hybrid search | **Verified in the engine** as one recursive query, including keyword branches |
| Multi-representation and branch-aware retrieval patterns | **Verified in the engine** for bounded named-vector/keyword prefetch and rerank programs |
| Search relevance tuning/evaluation helpers | **Partial** — deterministic recall gates, no product relevance suite |

## 4. Filtering and payload indexes

Sources: [filtering](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/search/filtering/) and
[indexing](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/manage-data/indexing/).

| Qdrant capability | RRFlow disposition |
|---|---|
| Boolean `must`, `should`, `must_not` and minimum-should filters | **Partial** — typed expressions are narrower |
| Exact match, any-of and except matching | **Partial** |
| Numeric and datetime range filters | **Partial/absent** depending on runtime type |
| Full-text and phrase matching | **Absent** |
| Geo bounding-box, radius and polygon filters | **Absent** |
| Empty/null checks and array value-count conditions | **Absent** |

| Nested-object filters with same-element semantics | **Absent** |
| Filter by payload paths/array members | **Partial** |
| Keyword payload index | **Verified in the engine** for exact scalar filter governance |

| Geo payload index | **Absent** |
| Full-text payload index with tokenizer/configuration | **Absent** |
| UUID payload index | **Partial** — exact digest kind exists, not Qdrant UUID semantics |
| Tenant-aware/principal payload index | **Absent** |
| On-disk payload index variants | **Absent** |
| Cardinality estimation and planner selection between scan/index/HNSW | **Partial** — exact/HNSW cost crossover uses typed-filter eligibility; richer payload statistics remain |
| One-stage filterable HNSW with filter-aware graph edges | **Core verified** for in-traversal admission and exact rerank; payload-index-derived edges remain absent |
| ACORN filtered traversal for restrictive combined filters | **Absent** |

## 5. Vector indexing and optimization

Sources: [indexing](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/manage-data/indexing/),
[GPU indexing](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/running-with-gpu/), and
[memory tiers](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/ops-configuration/memory-tiers/).

| Qdrant capability | RRFlow disposition |
|---|---|
| Mutable/background-built dense HNSW | **Engine core verified** — immediate authoritative delta plus incremental immutable successor generations; automatic scheduler/merge policy remains |
| Per-collection and per-named-vector `m`, `ef_construct`, full-scan threshold | **Partial** programmatic config |
| Sparse inverted index | **Absent** — sparse path is exact scanning |
| Automatic segment optimization, merge and index thresholds | **Partial** in RRD LSM; vector segment optimization is absent |
| Optimizer status and indexing progress | **Partial** catalogue only |
| GPU-accelerated HNSW indexing | **Engine boundary verified, production adapter absent** — CPU oracle, exact byte/descriptor parity, semantic probes, public prefer/require policy, safe fallback, durable evidence, and restart replay pass through one optional adapter registry |
| Vulkan GPU support across NVIDIA/AMD and selected devices | **Absent production adapter** — the provider-neutral registry can host a Vulkan implementation only after it declares exact format capability and passes the same CPU differential |
| CPU SIMD scoring | **Verified locally** for compact exact and four-metric HNSW traversal with scalar differential |
| mmap/on-disk vector access | **Verified locally** for compact dense exact artifacts |
| Per-structure `pinned`, `cached`, and `cold` memory tiers | **Partial/engine verified** — physical hard-bounded pinned, byte-bounded cached LRU, and transient cold mmap/owned behavior is enforced per named vector, not independently per structure |
| Independent tiers for original dense vectors, HNSW, quantized vectors, sparse index, payload and payload indexes | **Absent** |
| Startup cache warming and OS-evictable mmap tiers | **Partial** — cold supported codecs use verified read-only mmap and restart with empty process residency; automatic warming and explicit OS page-cache control are absent |
| On-disk vectors with in-memory graph | **Partial** — compact vector bytes mmap; HNSW artifact is not compact/on-disk production form |
| Strict-mode rejection of inefficient/unbounded queries and updates | **Partial** — resource contracts exist, not Qdrant-complete controls |
| Rate limits, filter-complexity, batch/result, timeout, index-count and storage caps | **Partial/mostly absent** |

## 6. Quantization

Source: [Qdrant quantization](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/manage-data/quantization/).

| Qdrant capability | RRFlow disposition |
|---|---|
| Scalar int8 quantization (4x compression) | **Verified in the engine** — immutable artifact-wide symmetric int8; not claimed format-equivalent to Qdrant |
| Binary quantization | **Verified in the engine** — packed sign-bit candidate artifact with exact canonical reranking |
| 1-bit, 1.5-bit and 2-bit encodings | **Verified in the engine** for deterministic MSE TurboQuant |
| Asymmetric binary-stored/scalar-query scoring | **Partial** — the query remains f32 but binary candidate scoring uses its sign bits before exact f32 reranking |
| Product quantization | **Verified in the engine** at packed-code ratios 4×, 8×, 16×, 32×, and 64×; codebook and total artifact bytes are separate evidence |
| TurboQuant random rotation and global distribution-aware mapping | **Verified in the engine** for the deterministic MSE variant; residual QJL is not implemented |
| TurboQuant 4/2/1.5/1-bit modes (8x–32x) | **Verified in the engine** |
| TurboQuant asymmetric full-precision query scoring | **Verified in the engine** with exact canonical reranking |
| SIMD TurboQuant scoring for cosine/dot/Euclidean | **Verified locally** through runtime-dispatched AVX2 rotated-dot scoring and scalar parity |
| Per-vector quantization settings | **Partial** — authenticated configuration is per named-vector artifact, not per point and not transport-bound yet |
| Store quantized and original vectors together | **Verified in the engine** — derived immutable objects coexist with authoritative full-f32 history |
| Oversampling and exact rescoring controls | **Engine core present** — bounded `exact_rerank` controls candidate count and final canonical scoring; no separate ratio-named outward field |
| Quantized-vector memory tier and inline storage controls | **Partial/engine verified** — active quantized artifacts obey the named-vector physical tier; independent quantized/original settings and inline controls are absent |
| Recall/compression/speed validation guidance and benchmark matrix | **Local engine evidence present** for 11 fixed 512×64 rows; production fixed-hardware scale/SLO qualification remains absent |

The standalone `ScalarQuantizedVector` remains a scalar oracle primitive and is
not presented as TurboQuant. RRFlow's lifecycle and binary formats are its own;
this inventory does not claim wire, format, or performance equivalence to
Qdrant.

## 14. Immediate conclusion

RRD's strongest overlap with Qdrant today is real but bounded: revisioned
collections and named vectors; atomic point batches and retirements; typed
payload-index lifecycle; exact dense/sparse/multivector values; online filtered
dense HNSW; exact reranking; model-bound provenance; immutable artifacts; mmap
dense search; WAL-backed persistence; snapshots; offline embedding/search; and
detailed causal runtime evidence. One bounded engine query now composes
nearest, keyword, recommendation, discovery, context, dense+sparse RRF,
multimodal reranking, model-pinned ColBERT MaxSim, MMR, groups, facets, and
directed matrices. It does **not** have Qdrant's full vector
product stack.

The critical missing blocks are generated collection/point bindings, richer
payload index families and statistics, ACORN/payload-derived graph edges,
DBSF/general formula operators, compact graph storage, physical quantized
memory tiers, physical GPU indexing, server inference, official
SDK qualification, REST/gRPC breadth, and production distribution.

Until those exist and pass fixed-corpus/fixed-hardware differentials, a RRFlow
versus Qdrant superiority claim would be false. The correct near-term claim is
that RRFlow owns an AI-reasoning-aware persistence and evidence kernel with some
verified vector primitives that Qdrant does not attempt to provide.
