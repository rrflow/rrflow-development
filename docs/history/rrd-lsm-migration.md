# Fjall and native-format storage migrations (historical)

**Status:** historical compatibility migration contract; scheduled for code
removal before the RRFlow 1.0 alpha
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/history/rrd-lsm-migration`
**Superseded by:** [`../reference/storage/rrflowkv-current-format.md`](../reference/storage/rrflowkv-current-format.md)
and [`../roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md`](../roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md)
**Reason:** C-05 and J-01 require the 1.0 executable to remove Fjall selection,
legacy readers, migration-only runtime paths, compatibility commands, and their
dependencies rather than normalize them as a supported product surface

This record preserves the design and executable inventory of two compatibility
systems present during pre-release convergence. It does not define supported
RRFlow 1.0 storage behavior and cannot close roadmap or POA&M status:

| Historical path | Implementation at classification | Operator commands | Executable proof | 1.0 disposition |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Fjall to native RRD LSM | `rrd-store/src/migration.rs`, `persistent.rs` | `storage migrate`, `storage status`, `storage rollback` | `rrd-store/tests/migration.rs`, `persistent.rs`, CLI operator tests | Remove under C-05/J-01 |
| Native TextV1 to TagV2 | `rrd-store/src/upgrade.rs`, legacy codecs in `keyspaces.rs` | `storage format-upgrade`, `storage format-status`, `storage format-rollback` | `rrd-store/tests/native_format_upgrade.rs`, CLI operator tests | Remove under C-05/J-01 |

Backend-independent logical archives, backups, and new-root restore are separate
recovery capabilities. Their presence beside these commands in the CLI does not
make them part of the compatibility paths classified by this record.

## Promise

The historical Fjall migration is an explicit, offline state transition. It
copies the byte-exact contents of all canonical Engine keyspaces from one
cross-keyspace Fjall read snapshot into an absent sibling RRD LSM directory.
The staged store is not made visible until its archive digest, per-keyspace
counts, total byte count, and semantic reopen checks all pass.

The original Fjall directory is retained after cutover. Initial migration does
not delete source data or its authenticated export. Rollback is allowed only
while the native store still has the exact manifest identity and sequence that
were recorded at cutover; otherwise it refuses to discard divergent writes.

## Frozen historical inventory

The migration format owns the ordered keyspace list in
`rrd_store::keyspaces::ALL`. A source containing any other keyspace is denied.
An empty canonical keyspace remains part of the inventory. This converts a new
keyspace from an easy-to-miss loop edit into an explicit migration-format
change.

## Archive (`RRDMIG01`, version 1)

The archive is streaming and bounded by the storage substrate's key/value
limits. It contains:

1. magic, version, zero flags, and the canonical ordered keyspace names;
2. ordered records: keyspace ordinal, key length, value length, key, value;
3. a footer with total entries, total key/value bytes, per-keyspace counts, and
   SHA-256 of the complete header and record stream.

Readers reject unsupported versions or flags, reordered/renamed keyspaces,
invalid ordinals, empty or oversized keys, oversized values, non-increasing
keys within a keyspace, inconsistent counters, digest mismatch, truncation, and
trailing bytes. The archive remains logical and independent of physical prefix
encoding. Import writes bounded RRD LSM batches into a manifest-authenticated
`RRDSK002` target and replaces each canonical keyspace name with its frozen
one-byte native tag. Existing manifest-v1 native stores remain readable through
the legacy `keyspace + NUL` codec; this migration never silently rewrites them.

The empty archive is frozen by
`../../crates/persistence/rrd-store/tests/fixtures/migration-v1-empty.hex`; an
incompatible byte change requires a new format version and golden vector.

## Native TextV1 to TagV2 exact-successor migration

At the time of this contract, `rrflow storage format-upgrade` was the explicit
offline migration from the legacy native textual-keyspace application format
to manifest-authenticated `RRDSK002` one-byte tags. No other source/target pair
is accepted. It reuses the same authenticated 18-keyspace logical archive, so
projections, invocation evidence, audit/outbox state, snapshots, and every
other allocated keyspace are preserved—not only claims and runtime state.

The authenticated sibling ledger advances through `exported`, `imported`,
`verified`, `source_moved`, `cutover`, and `complete`. Import is invisible in a
sibling staging root. Before moving the source, the migrator exports it again
and requires the same complete inventory, denying post-export writes. Cutover
retains the original TextV1 directory and archive. Resume reconciles both
unmarked directory-rename windows, and repeated completion is idempotent.

Tests inject failure after every durable phase and both rename boundaries,
verify post-export mutation denial, compare all logical keyspaces, reopen the
TagV2 result, and retain an independently openable TextV1 source. A separate
logical-recovery row exports an RRD archive from TextV1 and restores it into a
new current-format root.

The supported native application-format matrix is deliberately closed:

| Source fixture | Operation | Published target |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Native TextV1 root | `storage format-upgrade` | Native TagV2 root |
| Logical archive exported from Native TextV1 | `storage archive-restore` into an absent root | Native TagV2 root |

There is no generic numeric-version upgrader and no skipped-version route.
TagV2, unknown application-format values, unregistered keyspaces, and any
source/target pair not listed above are denied. A future row requires a new
reviewed exact-successor implementation and recovery fixture.

`storage format-rollback` is the reverse recovery operation, not another
forward matrix edge. It is available only after cutover or completion. Before
moving anything it verifies the visible TagV2 root against the authenticated
archive and recorded cutover manifest, and verifies the retained TextV1 root
against the same complete inventory. It then moves TagV2 to a retained sibling
and restores TextV1. Both reverse rename windows reconcile on retry. The
archive, restored TextV1 root, and displaced TagV2 root are all retained; no
rollback phase deletes evidence. Any successor write or ambiguous filesystem
state denies rollback.

## Durable phases

Both implementations publish phase changes through a synced temporary JSON
file, rename, and parent-directory sync. The Fjall path stores a plain
`MigrationReport`; its marker is not self-authenticated, although the archive,
source inventory, and native state identity are verified. The native-format
path wraps its `FormatMigrationLedger` with a SHA-256 digest and rejects a
ledger whose digest or version differs.

Their shared forward phases are:

1. `exported` — the source was synced and one consistent snapshot was archived.
2. `imported` — the absent native staging directory contains every archive row.
3. `verified` — its visible inventory and digest match the archive and it
   reopens as a native Engine.
4. `source_moved` — the source was renamed to the retained backup sibling.
5. `cutover` — staging was renamed to the requested database path and its
   native state token was recorded.
6. `complete` — a final native reopen and semantic status read succeeded.

The rollback intermediate differs by implementation. Fjall rollback records
`rollback_native_moved`; native-format rollback records
`rollback_target_moved`. Both finish at `rolled_back`. The native-format ledger
authenticates these states. The Fjall report does not, so it instead revalidates
the retained roots, archive inventory, and recorded native state token.

Filesystem state is authoritative when a crash lands between a rename and its
marker update. Resume recognizes those states and advances rather than
re-exporting or overwriting an artifact. Normal `PersistentEngine::open`
refuses an active marker so a missing path cannot become a new empty database
during the cutover window.

## Recovery rules

- Before `source_moved`, Fjall remains the only visible database and resume may
  reconstruct an invalid staging directory from the authenticated archive.
- Between `source_moved` and `cutover`, resume completes the staging rename; it
  never creates a fresh database at the now-missing source path.
- At or after `cutover`, resume verifies the native state token and completes.
- Rollback moves the unchanged native directory to a retained sibling, restores
  the Fjall backup, and records `rolled_back`. Every artifact remains available
  for diagnosis.
- Unknown, ambiguous, divergent, or corrupt states are denied and require an
  operator decision. Migration never guesses.
- After rollback, forward migration does not silently reuse the old ledger.
  The retained three-part evidence set remains authoritative for diagnosis.

## Historical evidence inventory and removal disposition

The executable tests attached to this historical design cover complete
multi-keyspace migration, corrupt/truncated archive refusal, unknown-keyspace
refusal, restart at every phase boundary, idempotent resume, rollback before
native divergence, rollback refusal after divergence, reverse-rename recovery,
every admitted source row reopening on TagV2, and stable backend selection. The
old acceptance proposal also required a deterministic
put/update/delete/reopen/compaction soak comparing RRD LSM and Fjall against an
independent ordered-map model.

That evidence explains what the compatibility paths did; it is not evidence
that they should survive. Current acceptance is the inverse: C-05 requires
repository and dependency proof that these selectors, readers, migrations, and
commands are absent, while J-01 prohibits legacy or compatibility execution
paths in the release.

This design follows the operational invariants—not code—of RocksDB checkpoints
([one consistent database view and an absent target](https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/Checkpoints)),
Qdrant snapshot restore
([explicit restore into a clean target](https://qdrant.tech/documentation/snapshots/)),
and SurrealDB logical migration
([validate imported state before switching](https://surrealdb.com/docs/build/deployment/surrealdb-cloud/operations/migrating-data)).
Those systems remain benchmark baselines; the document makes no unmeasured
superiority claim.
