# RRD LSM promotion benchmark (historical)

**Status:** historical local comparison note; not current RRFlow 1.0 promotion or release evidence
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/history/rrd-lsm-promotion-benchmark`
**Superseded by:** [`../reference/storage/rrflowkv-benchmark-harness.md`](../reference/storage/rrflowkv-benchmark-harness.md)
and [`../roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md`](../roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md)
**Reason:** this note mixed methodology, dated results, invalidated runs, and
release language; its JSON artifacts omit the exact execution revision and
adequate host/toolchain provenance required by the current roadmap

This record preserves the August 2026 local results and the limitations known
at that time. Its internal word `promotion` refers only to the old harness's
Fjall comparison verdict. It cannot close C-05, C-06, J-02, J-03, J-04, or
J-05 and must not be cited as current performance evidence. Present-tense
statements below describe the checkout and conclusions at the time of those
runs, not the current architecture or release state.

The benchmark runs Fjall and native `RRD LSM` in separate fresh child processes.
Both receive the same valid claim corpus, authoritative batch boundaries, and
bounded sequence replays. Writes are measured in isolated writer children.
Each backend is measured at the same three lifecycle boundaries: active,
cleanly reopened without explicit maintenance, and explicitly maintained then
reopened. Format 4 verifies the complete corpus after both reopens in
`read-width` pages, checking exact cardinality and every append-ordinal object;
it never substitutes a sample for correctness. Footprint evidence
reports apparent and allocated bytes plus file-class attribution instead of
mistaking sparse logical length for physical allocation. The parent alternates
backend order, reports medians, and retains every raw trial.

Historical command recorded with the checked-in workload:

```console
cargo run --release --locked -p rrd-store --example engine_benchmark -- \
  --trials 9 --operations 2048 --batch-size 64 \
  --reads 1024 --read-width 32 \
  --output eval/results/2026-08-23-rrd-lsm-standard-streaming-scan-v4.json
```

The corrected 2026-08-23 x86-64 Linux rerun is one deliberately modest local
workload, not a universal database claim. Ratios above 1 favor native for
throughput; ratios below 1 favor native for latency, RSS, and footprint:

| Metric | Native versus Fjall | Gate |
|---|---:|---|
| Authoritative write throughput | 1.238× | Pass |
| Clean-reopen read throughput | 1.726× | Pass |
| Authoritative write p95 | 0.781× | Pass |
| Clean-reopen read p95 | 0.603× | Pass |
| Maintained read throughput | 1.280× | Diagnostic |
| Maintained read p95 | 0.795× | Diagnostic |
| Clean-reopen recovery | 0.154× | Pass |
| Maintained recovery | 0.227× | Diagnostic |
| Steady probe peak RSS | 0.874× | Pass |
| Clean-reopen allocated footprint | 0.915× | Pass |

Correctness and every strict performance cell passed in all nine aggregated
trials. The change set removes duplicated inline claims from current sequence
index writes, caches validated batch length, keeps exact-length payloads and
the common one-version chain inline, transfers decoded recovery ownership
directly into the memtable, and streams each WAL frame exactly once into the
database open path. Native writes
are grouped by logical keyspace for ordered-tree locality. On Linux, only a
substantial first batch in the initial WAL receives one best-effort 1 MiB
`KEEP_SIZE` reservation; it never changes logical recovery length, grows, or
applies to successor WALs. The high-entropy AI footprint gate verifies that
this bounded reservation does not erase RRFlow's allocation result. Atomic batch
v2 encodes put/delete in the high bit of the value-length word, removing four
bytes per physical mutation. Recovery remains strict for both frozen v1 and v2
golden vectors. Mutable-only scans now visit borrowed visible rows directly,
and the native sequence reader deserializes each row as it arrives. Format-4
verification consequently retains only one bounded page while still checking
the entire corpus and reports process `VmHWM` across recovery, verification,
and measured reads.

At the time of this record, Fjall remained a compatibility and performance oracle. The scheduled and
manually dispatchable workflow runs with `--require-promotion`; remote and
extended-RSS reproduction remain retirement gates. The repository may claim only
the bounded results recorded here; it may not infer general superiority over
Fjall, SurrealDB, Qdrant, or other databases.

Evidence: [`2026-08-23-rrd-lsm-standard-streaming-scan-v4.json`](../../eval/results/2026-08-23-rrd-lsm-standard-streaming-scan-v4.json).

## Scale qualification remains open

The scheduled five-profile matrix is intentionally stricter than the canonical
fixture. The prior corrected format-3 run passed small-batch and standard;
read-heavy missed only raw peak RSS at 1.015× Fjall. Exact-length boxed values
and a one-or-many chain representation then removed one capacity word from each
version and eight bytes from each overwhelmingly single-version key. The
format-4 nine-trial matrix closes the read-heavy and sustained cells at 0.908×
and 0.979× RSS respectively. Their write p95 ratios are 0.934× and 0.764×, so
the prior tail misses do not reproduce. The 70,000-operation extended cell
improves from the original 1.181× RSS to 1.026× (53,968 versus 52,616 KiB) after
compact residency and streaming paged verification. Batch v2 removes exactly
562,188 extended WAL-payload bytes and
moves extended clean-reopen allocation from 1.004× to 0.987×. The deterministic
footprint gap is closed. Backend-native maintained reads remain diagnostic
because the maintenance actions differ.

Manifest v2 now authenticates native application format `RRDSK002`; its frozen
one-byte keyspace tags remove exactly 1,400,004 extended live key-payload bytes.
The final direct-tag nine-trial extended rerun passes every strict cell: 1.390×
write throughput, 0.662× write p95, 1.715× read throughput, 0.589× read p95,
0.218× recovery, 0.984× RSS (51,820 versus 52,680 KiB), and 0.945× allocated
footprint. The old
1.026× RSS failure remains checked in as historical evidence rather than being
overwritten.

The new physical evidence explains the shape rather than inferring it from RSS.
At sustained scale, 32,896 versions occupy 32,769 keys; only one chain spills.
At extended scale, 140,547 versions occupy 140,001 keys; again only one chain
spills. The extended attributable lower bound is 38,505,092 bytes: 7,980,030
key-payload bytes, 23,780,438 value-payload bytes, compact per-key fields, and
one 1,024-record history allocation. B-tree node metadata, allocator overhead,
fragmentation, process baseline, and page residency are explicitly excluded;
the counter is not mislabeled as RSS.

The post-format canonical, sustained, extended, and eight prior AI profiles are
green. A same-machine read-heavy rerun records bimodal fsync-sensitive native
write p95 and fails that one cell despite favorable throughput, read, recovery,
RSS, and allocation results. It remains red until repeated remote evidence can
separate host storage variance from a reproducible regression. Evidence:
[`read-heavy streaming-scan v4`](../../eval/results/2026-08-23-rrd-lsm-read-heavy-streaming-scan-v4.json),
[`sustained streaming-scan v4`](../../eval/results/2026-08-23-rrd-lsm-sustained-streaming-scan-v4.json),
[`extended compact-tag v4`](../../eval/results/2026-08-23-rrd-lsm-extended-keyspace-tag-v2-v4.json),
and [`read-heavy red diagnostic`](../../eval/results/2026-08-23-rrd-lsm-read-heavy-direct-tag-v2-v4.json).
Fjall compatibility retirement still requires the repeated remote matrix; the
repository does not average the read-heavy tail miss away.

## Invalidated legacy M3/M3.5 evidence

The 2026-08-21 bounded-compaction and negative-filter tree reran the former
canonical standard profile with nine alternating isolated trials. Native passed every
strict cell at 1.151× write throughput, 1.702× read throughput, 0.788× write
p95, 0.611× read p95, 0.258× recovery time, 0.855× steady RSS, and 0.310× disk
relative to Fjall. Correctness passed in every raw trial.

A same-tree three-trial diagnostic failed once because native write p95 was
1.044× Fjall while the other six performance cells passed. Three trials leave
only 96 total write-latency samples for this profile, so that diagnostic is
recorded as undersampling rather than presented as promotion evidence. The
nine-trial result below is retained as historical diagnostic evidence only:
[`2026-08-21-rrd-lsm-m35-standard.json`](../../eval/results/2026-08-21-rrd-lsm-m35-standard.json).

Those runs applied compaction/GC to native before its read and footprint probe
without an equivalent Fjall maintenance phase. They also summed apparent file
length, counting Fjall's sparse 64 MiB journal as physically consumed space.
They therefore cannot support promotion, even though their internal semantic
checks remain useful.

## Legacy profile matrix (not promotion evidence)

A second pass uses nine isolated trials per profile. Every profile has at least
32 authoritative batch-latency samples per trial; a discarded 512-operation,
32-wide micro-profile had only 16 samples, which makes nearest-rank p95 equal
the single maximum and is not valid promotion evidence.

| Profile | Operations / batch | Reads / width | Write throughput | Read throughput | Write p95 | Read p95 | Recovery | RSS | Apparent bytes | Status |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| Small-batch | 2,048 / 16 | 1,024 / 16 | 1.039× | 1.661× | 0.982× | 0.604× | 0.264× | 0.860× | 0.308× | Legacy |
| Standard | 2,048 / 64 | 1,024 / 32 | 1.159× | 1.622× | 0.892× | 0.646× | 0.272× | 0.841× | 0.310× | Legacy |
| Read-heavy | 4,096 / 64 | 4,096 / 64 | 1.096× | 1.670× | 0.912× | 0.600× | 0.304× | 0.882× | 0.314× | Legacy |
| Sustained | 16,384 / 128 | 2,048 / 64 | 1.177× | 1.178× | 0.882× | 0.855× | 0.331× | 0.843× | 0.317× | Legacy |

Throughput ratios above 1 favor native; latency, RSS, and apparent-byte ratios
below 1 favor native. All cells preserve semantic correctness, but asymmetric
maintenance and sparse-file accounting invalidate their performance verdicts.
The sustained result is the combined effect of disk-resident blocks, compact
`u32` record offsets, the
strict generation-based LRU, streaming one-segment scans, and self-serving
native sequence values (the former inline format, no longer emitted); no
benchmark threshold was relaxed in that legacy harness.

Raw evidence:

- [`small-batch`](../../eval/results/2026-08-19-rrd-lsm-small-batch.json)
- [`standard`](../../eval/results/2026-08-19-rrd-lsm-standard.json)
- [`read-heavy`](../../eval/results/2026-08-19-rrd-lsm-read-heavy.json)
- [`sustained`](../../eval/results/2026-08-19-rrd-lsm-sustained.json)
- [`extended`](../../eval/results/2026-08-20-rrd-lsm-extended.json)

The three-trial extended cell raises the corpus to 70,000 operations while
retaining the sustained batch/read shape. Native recorded 47,729,952 encoded
WAL payload bytes and 140,547 memtable versions under its 64 MiB/524,288-version
limits, with zero automatic flushes, stalls, failures, or oversized batches.
It reported 1.214× write throughput, 1.289× read throughput, 0.853× write p95,
0.771× read p95, 0.269× recovery, 0.673× steady RSS, and 0.317× apparent bytes.
It preserves a larger-workload diagnostic, not valid promotion evidence.

The scheduled/manual general workflow preserves one artifact per profile and
uses `--require-promotion`; the corrected local canonical execution now passes.
The legacy matrix spans corpus size, batch size, read count, and range width. It
still uses an append
then bounded-replay claim corpus; update/delete mixtures, long-duration soak,
and long-duration/remote repetition remain separate gates before Fjall code
removal. The finite mixed-mutation and migration gates are now recorded below.

## Physical mutation and migration gates

The checked-in `mixed_storage_soak` applies 20,000 deterministic operations
(4,558 inserts, 11,380 overwrites, and 4,062 deletes) over 2,048 keys. It forces
10 native/Fjall reopens and 8 native compactions and compares both stores to an
independent `BTreeMap` after every fifth batch. All three finish with 1,669
visible keys and SHA-256
`66f466b2d88a0c82bd9a2d929f8fd69312a26f28df102fb89e6e97273cb53f40`.
Evidence: [`m4-storage-mixed-soak.json`](../evidence/m4-storage-mixed-soak.json).

The migration matrix exports one synced cross-keyspace Fjall snapshot into the
authenticated `RRFLOWIG01` stream, imports bounded native batches into an absent
staging sibling, verifies exact bytes and semantic reopen, and then cuts over
with two parent-synced renames. Tests interrupt and resume after export, import,
verification, both source/cutover rename gaps, source move, and cutover. They
also deny unknown keyspaces, corrupt/truncated archives, and rollback after
post-cutover native writes. See [`rrd-lsm-migration.md`](../rrd-lsm-migration.md).

This is a physical ordered-key/value deletion result. It does not claim a typed
runtime entity-deletion contract, which must define relation and projection
effects before it can be added safely.

## AI-runtime profiles

The append/replay matrix is not representative of all frontier-runtime access.
The dedicated AI-read matrix publishes a cold immutable corpus, overwrites a
small control set in the active memtable, and independently measures current
hot hits, cold immutable hits, point misses, historical reads, and 32-key mixed
metadata fan-out. It runs repeated-byte, structured JSON,
deterministic-entropy, and embedding-like payloads as applicable. All eight
local five-trial cells pass exact correctness, native-throughput, native-p95,
and clean-reopen allocated-footprint gates. The design audit, commands, bounded
claims, and versioned raw results are in
[`rrd-lsm-fjall-ai-audit.md`](../rrd-lsm-fjall-ai-audit.md). The scheduled/manual
workflow reruns each mode and retains its raw artifact separately from the
general promotion matrix.
