# RRD LSM native format contract

Status: supporting native-format and benchmark evidence; the corrected nine-trial local
general performance fixture now passes every strict cell. Remote reproduction
and remote reproduction remain promotion gates. WAL, checkpoint/`CURRENT`, and
physical snapshot-bundle formats are version 1. Manifests are version 2 with
strict version-1 reads. Atomic mutation writes are version 2
with strict version-1 recovery. New immutable segments are version 3 and the
reader retains explicit version-1/version-2 compatibility.
The format is pre-release. Any format change before alpha must increment its
explicit version and update the checked-in vectors; readers never guess.

The active mutable layer is bounded by configurable encoded-WAL-payload and
memtable-version limits (64 MiB and 524,288 versions by default). Before
admitting a batch that would cross either limit, the single writer synchronously
publishes the existing WAL-backed memtable through the normal crash-ordered
flush path. This is
intentional backpressure: the new batch is not appended until maintenance
succeeds. One atomic batch is never split; a batch larger than a configured
limit remains one WAL frame and is reported as oversized. Maintenance counters
are operational evidence and reset on reopen. The same evidence reports L0
count/trigger/debt, automatic compaction count/failures, compacted input/output
bytes, and peak merge-buffer bytes. WAL, segment, manifest, and `CURRENT`
remain the canonical persistence truth.

Runtime entry points use `PersistentEngine`: a missing path creates this native
format, and an authenticated `CURRENT` pointer selects it on reopen. An existing
directory without that marker remains on the Fjall compatibility adapter. The
selector never probes partial native internals or rewrites an existing store.

## Durability boundary

One accepted atomic batch is one WAL frame. `Authoritative` acknowledgment is
returned only after `sync_data`; `Buffered` acknowledgment states that the frame
was written but is not yet claimed durable. A failed write or sync poisons that
writer instance. The caller must recover and reopen rather than append behind an
unknown partial write.

The WAL admits only contiguous, non-zero sequence ranges. Recovery replays the
longest valid prefix in order. Sequence reuse, gaps, and overflow fail before a
write begins.

## WAL v1

All integers are unsigned big-endian.

File header (16 bytes):

| Offset | Bytes | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 8 | ASCII `RRDWAL01` |
| 8 | 2 | format version (`1`) |
| 10 | 2 | file-header length (`16`) |
| 12 | 4 | CRC32C over bytes `0..12` |

Batch frame header (32 bytes):

| Offset | Bytes | Meaning |
|---:|---:|---|
| 0 | 4 | ASCII `RRD1` |
| 4 | 2 | format version (`1`) |
| 6 | 1 | record kind (`1`, atomic batch) |
| 7 | 1 | flags (`0`; unknown flags fail closed) |
| 8 | 4 | payload length, capped at 16 MiB |
| 12 | 8 | first MVCC sequence |
| 20 | 8 | last MVCC sequence |
| 28 | 4 | CRC32C over header bytes `4..28` and the payload |

The outer WAL treats the payload as bytes so recovery does not need higher-level
schema code.

## Atomic mutation batch v2

The current payload begins with `RRDBAT02`, a `u16` version, zero `u16` flags,
and a `u32` operation count. Each operation contains a `u32` key length and a
`u32` tagged value length, then key/value bytes. Bit 31 of the tagged length
marks delete and requires all length bits to be zero; a clear bit denotes put,
including an empty value. This removes the v1 kind byte and three reserved
bytes without weakening validation. Empty batches/keys, mismatched
magic/version pairs, non-zero batch flags, delete-with-length, trailing bytes,
and lengths outside the declared limits fail closed. One MVCC sequence is
allocated per operation while the whole batch remains one atomic WAL frame.

The reader also accepts frozen v1 payloads beginning with `RRDBAT01`. V1 keeps
its one-byte kind, three zero operation-flag bytes, and `u32` key/value lengths.
New writes are always canonical v2; a recovered v1 batch is re-encoded as v2 if
written again.

After a memtable flush, the successor WAL starts at the manifest's declared
`wal_start_sequence`; recovery takes that boundary explicitly, so an empty
rotated WAL still has an unambiguous next sequence and replay under the wrong
manifest fails.

## Recovery classification

- An incomplete file header is corruption: no valid WAL identity exists.
- A partial final frame header or payload is a torn tail. Recovery returns its
  exact start offset and never mutates the file.
- `repair_torn_tail` is the only truncation path. It truncates to the reported
  valid-prefix boundary and syncs the file.
- Bad magic, version, kind, flags, length, sequence, or checksum in a complete
  frame is corruption. It is never silently reclassified as a torn write.
- Replaying unchanged bytes is idempotent and returns the same batch list and
  valid boundary.

## Manifest v2

A manifest is immutable, has a monotonic generation, names its parent digest
after generation 1, declares the durable/WAL sequence boundary, and lists every
reachable immutable segment. Segment order is canonicalized by level, first
key, and content identity before hashing. A manifest's SHA-256 digest excludes
only its own `digest` field.

Version 2 also authenticates an optional non-zero `application_format`. The
physical KV layer treats that identity as opaque and preserves it through every
flush, compaction, and snapshot install. Native `rrd-store` databases bind the
identity `RRDSK002` and encode each of the 18 frozen logical keyspaces as one
stable non-zero byte before the logical key. This replaces repeated
`keyspace-name + NUL` prefixes without making key interpretation heuristic.
Unknown native application identities fail closed. Physical snapshot install
requires identical source/target application formats; cross-format transfer is
a logical migration, never an implicit physical rewrite.

The reader retains manifest v1 exactly: absence of `application_format` selects
the legacy textual native-key codec and the digest is recomputed over the
original v1 field set. The `CURRENT` pointer and named-checkpoint control files
remain format 1 because their wire shape did not change. New unbound low-level
databases use manifest v2 with no application identity.

Every segment descriptor carries its content identity/checksum, key range,
sequence range, entry count, and byte count. Duplicate identities, inverted
ranges, empty segments, and segments newer than the manifest's durable sequence
fail closed. L0 may overlap by definition; every higher level must contain
strictly ordered, non-overlapping key ranges.

Immutable segment v3 stores a fixed 64-byte `RRDSEG03` header, independently
compressed LZ4 record blocks, a bounded `RRDIX003` footer index, and a lowercase
ASCII SHA-256 footer over every preceding physical byte. The header declares
the entry/sequence range, total uncompressed record bytes, index offset, block
count, and the canonical 4 KiB query target. A record is never split: the one-record
oversize exception is bounded by the 1 MiB key plus 8 MiB value contract.

Each index entry declares physical offset/length, decoded length, entry count,
last key, and SHA-256 of the compressed bytes. Offsets must exactly cover the
data region, last keys are non-decreasing so one key may span blocks, and the
index is capped at 64 MiB. Open streams the outer digest with a 64 KiB buffer,
then decodes and validates one block at a time. Runtime reads recheck the block
digest with optimized SHA-256 over the raw 32-byte expected digest before LZ4
decode, so post-open file mutation fails closed without allocating hex strings. Unknown
flags, length/count disagreement, invalid ordering, corrupt compression, gaps,
overlap, and trailing bytes are denied.

Point reads return owned values and load only candidate blocks. A single
immutable segment reduces ordered MVCC groups directly into range results;
multi-segment reads retain the general version merge. Snapshot and compaction
traversal process blocks sequentially. During authenticated v3 validation RRFlow
derives one block-local Bloom filter using ten bits per physical entry and seven
deterministic double-hash probes. These filters are acceleration state derived
from checksum-verified canonical bytes, not a second persistence truth; a
negative result skips block load/decode, while positives still execute the
ordinary exact MVCC path. Probe and negative counts join physical evidence.
All immutable
segments in one `Database` share a decoded-block LRU: 4 MiB by default,
configurable at create/open, with capacity/resident/entry/hit/miss/eviction
counters exposed by `block_cache_stats`. A block larger than the configured
cache is decoded for its caller but never retained. Version-1 `RRDSEG01`
uncompressed and version-2 `RRDSEG02` single-block files remain readable through
explicit legacy branches; writers emit only version 3.
Put/tombstone records retain every version needed for an older snapshot. Files
are named by their physical-content digest, written to a unique temporary,
synced, atomically renamed, and followed by a directory sync. Reusing an
existing content identity first revalidates the complete segment.

Named checkpoints are separately checksummed, atomically published files that
pin an immutable manifest generation. Names use a path-safe canonical grammar;
repeating identical bytes is idempotent, rebinding a name fails closed, and
release is explicit and directory-synced. Retention and GC consume this
inventory rather than inferring reachability from filenames.

## Physical snapshot bundle v1

`SnapshotBundle` is the transferable physical closure of one flush-bounded
manifest. Export first completes the normal WAL → segment → successor-WAL →
manifest publication sequence. Consequently the captured manifest requires
`wal_start_sequence == durable_sequence + 1`: its successor WAL is empty, and
all state needed at the snapshot boundary is carried by immutable segments.

The binary envelope uses unsigned big-endian lengths:

| Field | Bytes | Meaning |
|---|---:|---|
| magic | 8 | ASCII `RRDSNP01` |
| version | 2 | snapshot-bundle format `1` |
| flags | 2 | zero; unknown flags fail closed |
| manifest length | 4 | canonical JSON manifest bytes |
| segment count | 4 | number of following segment records |
| manifest | variable | authenticated source manifest |
| each segment | `4 + 8 + n + m` | descriptor length, byte length, descriptor JSON, exact `.seg` bytes |
| bundle digest | 64 | lowercase ASCII SHA-256 over every preceding byte |

The envelope is capped at 1 GiB and one million segments. Validation checks the
outer digest, manifest digest and invariants, exact descriptor order, and every
segment's authenticated physical bytes before installation can publish
anything.

Installation does not adopt the source manifest's history. It materializes
content-addressed segment files, creates and syncs the empty continuation WAL,
then creates a new local manifest whose parent is the target's prior `CURRENT`.
One pointer publication makes the imported state visible. A bundle must advance
the local physical sequence; reinstalling the already-current segment closure
is idempotent, while stale bundles fail closed. Writes continue at exactly
`source durable_sequence + 1`.

Deterministic crash and storage-full injection covers synchronized segments,
the successor WAL, and manifest publication. Failures before publication reopen
the old state and can retry over authenticated orphan files. A failure after
publication reopens the imported state. Corruption, truncation, stale install,
round-trip, reopen, idempotency, target-state replacement, and post-install
continuation are executable tests in `tests/snapshot_bundle.rs`.

`SnapshotBundleFile` preserves these exact v1 bytes while exporting through a
64 KiB copy/hash buffer and validating one segment at a time. File creation is
`create_new`, synchronized before use, and removes partial output on ordinary
failure. Deterministic crash/storage-full injection covers header-written,
segment-written, and file-synced boundaries. The Linux memory regression uses
a bundle larger than 16 MiB and caps incremental export RSS at 16 MiB. A second
Linux process regression opens and reads 20 MiB of immutable segments with a
4 MiB shared cache, requires eviction, and caps RSS growth at 16 MiB.

OpenRaft adapter v4 consumes this exact contract for canonical-state transfer.
It inspects the authenticated state/domain records before installation, then
publishes the imported closure through the same local manifest CAS. Vote, log,
commit, purge, and snapshot-cache records live in a separate node-local RRD LSM
domain and therefore cannot appear in the bundle.

The native `Engine` adapter passes Memory/Fjall/native semantic and exact query
differentials, including flush/reopen. One compaction step selects a bounded,
deterministic source-level range plus every overlapping target-level segment,
then performs a k-way merge through forward-only segment cursors. Output is
split at key boundaries against an 8 MiB default target, retaining at most the
target plus one key's complete MVCC history in the merge map. Manifest CAS
publishes all output partitions together.

Explicit compaction retains the newest version visible at every protected
physical sequence plus the durable head; an obsolete tombstone disappears only
when no unselected segment can contain the shadowed key. Cooperative automatic
maintenance deliberately retains every MVCC version because the low-level
copyable `Snapshot` is not a lifetime-tracked reclamation lease. Runtime leases
create physical manifest checkpoints and reconcile them on reopen, compaction,
release, and expiry. GC validates the complete root inventory, then removes
only manifests, segments, and WALs unreachable from `CURRENT` or a named
checkpoint.

Deterministic crash and storage-full injection covers the WAL-sync,
segment-sync, successor-WAL-sync, and manifest-publication flush boundaries,
plus compaction segment and manifest publication. Every cell reopens, verifies
the accepted data, continues writing, and reopens again. Comparative evidence
is recorded in `rrd-lsm-benchmark.md`. The corrected lifecycle harness measures
both engines while active, after clean reopen, and after explicit maintenance,
and reports physical allocation rather than sparse apparent length. Semantics
and the bounded AI-read matrix pass. The corrected nine-trial local general
fixture now also passes write throughput/p95, clean-reopen reads/recovery/RSS,
and allocated footprint after compact sequence references and streaming
one-pass recovery. Compact authenticated keyspace tags then removed exactly
1,400,004 live key-payload bytes at 70,000 claims. A nine-trial extended rerun
moved clean-reopen RSS from 1.026× Fjall to 0.984× and allocated bytes from
0.987× to 0.945× while preserving complete-corpus verification. A subsequent
read-heavy rerun exposed bimodal authoritative-write p95 and is retained as a
red local diagnostic pending remote reproduction; favorable scale cells are
not averaged over it. Fjall remains live as a compatibility and performance
oracle; no general native database superiority claim is made.

Manifest publication now holds an OS-level exclusive lock for the publication
session. It validates expected `CURRENT`, generation, and parent; syncs immutable
manifest bytes; atomically renames a separately checksummed `CURRENT` pointer;
then syncs the containing directory. Stale compare-and-swap expectations fail
without changing reachability. Compaction publishes through the same CAS
boundary and leaves its input graph unreachable—but intact—until GC.

Database flush follows the crash-safe publication order directly: sync the
active WAL, write/sync/rename the content-addressed segment, create and sync the
successor WAL, persist the next manifest, then advance `CURRENT`. Crashing
before `CURRENT` leaves only unreachable artifacts and recovers the old WAL;
crashing after it finds both the new segment and successor WAL. Old WALs remain
reachable through historical manifests/checkpoints until GC proves otherwise.

CRC32C calculation uses the platform-dispatched implementation while retaining
the exact v1 bytes and published `123456789` check value. The tests also cover
ordered replay, reopen/continuation, invalid batches, partial headers, partial
payloads, complete checksum corruption, unknown versions, explicit repair, and

tampering, compressed-body corruption, checksum failure, truncation, and Linux
