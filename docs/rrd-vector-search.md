# RRD vector/search, online HNSW, and unified retrieval contract

Status: supporting implemented vector-search contract; remaining index and
routing gates live in [`roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md`](roadmap/rrflow-1.0.md).

`rrd-vector` is the rebuildable search layer over canonical `RuntimeVector`
versions. The data-runtime commit log remains truth. An index may accelerate a
query, but it cannot invent freshness, visibility, filtering, scoring, or
ordering semantics.

## Frozen semantics

- Queries are scoped by a validated `ReadStamp`, transaction cursor, and valid
  time.
- Dense, sparse, and multi-dense `MaxSim` exact search support cosine, dot,
  Euclidean, and Manhattan scoring. Higher is always better; distance metrics
  return negative distance.
- The latest transaction-visible version wins for each vector identity. A
  future valid-time version does not hide an earlier applicable version; a
  retired latest version does.
- Exact integer/unsigned/decimal/string filters implement `equals`,
  `not_equals`, `in`, ranges, existence, `all`, `any`, and `not`, with explicit
  missing-property behavior and bounded AST depth/size.
- Optional exact embedding-model bindings prevent same-shaped but incompatible
  vector spaces from being mixed by exact scans, artifacts, or the planner.
- Duplicate `(vector identity, source cursor)` versions, dimensional drift,
  non-finite values, corrupt artifacts, wrong fields/metrics/scopes, incomplete
  filter coverage, and stale generations fail closed.
- Result ordering is score descending, reference ascending, then source cursor
  descending. The borrowing exact API avoids a corpus copy on the hot path.

The portable contract and projection identities are frozen by
`crates/compute/rrd-vector/fixtures/vector-search-v1.json`.

## Persistent collection control

The product-facing control surface is executable. A
`VectorCollectionRepository` stores a versioned catalogue in authoritative
control state and advances it through compare-and-swap journal transitions.
Each collection owns one or more named vector definitions binding field, value
kind, dimensions, metric, optional embedding-model digest, and requested
pinned/cached/cold placement. Accepted mutations retain bounded operation
receipts so exact retries survive restart and changed payloads under one key
conflict.

RRD exposes authenticated collection and typed payload-index lifecycle
operations with separate deny-by-default actions. Collection-addressed search
resolves the stored definition and rejects kind/dimension drift before planning.
Atomic point batches and valid-time retirement use the same `RuntimeCommit`
authority as every other logical model. Retrieve, scroll, exact search, HNSW,
and collection-deletion preflight reduce that history at one read stamp.

RRD search exposes the oracle's complete bounded payload-filter algebra:
equals/not-equals, membership, range, existence, and recursive all/any/not.
The server lowers public values into one filter evaluator rather than
maintaining transport-specific semantics. HNSW configuration may name only
active typed payload indexes; deletion of a property used by an active HNSW or
TurboQuant artifact fails closed. The same expression participates in graph
layer-zero admission and final exact reranking, including nested all/any/not,
equality, inequality, membership, range, and existence semantics.

`POST /v1/vector/points/scroll` adds the first dedicated point-read lifecycle
operation. It resolves the named collection space, captures one authoritative
read stamp, calls the same `materialize_visible` primitive as search, applies an
optional payload filter, orders exact references, and returns bounded vector,
provenance, payload, source-cursor, and resume evidence. The route has its own
deny-by-default action.

`POST /v1/vector/points/retrieve` accepts a bounded unique identity batch,
resolves the same collection visibility snapshot, returns found points in
request order, and explicitly returns missing references. It has an independent
authorization action and does not infer absence from an omitted result.
Point deletion is the ordinary batched `retire_data` mutation. Collection
deletion remains fail-closed while points or active approximate artifacts exist.

## Unified multimodal retrieval

`RrdEngine::execute_retrieval_query` is the engine-owned recursive query path
for nearest, keyword, recommendation, discovery, context, fusion, reranking,
grouping, faceting, and matrix operations. It captures one read stamp and one
collection catalogue for the complete program. Dense, sparse, keyword, image,
and multi-dense late-interaction representations therefore compose inside RRD
instead of application middleware.

Bounded nested prefetch supports weighted reciprocal-rank fusion and ordered
score-boost, exact, model-pinned MaxSim, and MMR stages. Every payload-dependent
stage requires an active typed payload index. The result publishes a complete
query-plan digest, ordered input/output/exactness evidence for every stage, and
per-hit rank/score contributions. Group/facet results operate over the bounded
query candidate universe; multi-dense matrices are directed because MaxSim is
not generally symmetric.

The exact semantics, amplification limits, security boundary, evidence model,
and honest remaining gaps are frozen in
[`rrd-unified-retrieval-v1.md`](rrd-unified-retrieval-v1.md). Generated outward
bindings remain G06 work.

## Rebuildable projections

Two canonical JSON reference artifacts currently exist:

1. `ImmutableVectorSegment` stores authenticated exact candidate history.
2. `HnswIndex` format v2 stores deterministic dense-vector HNSW with a wider
   layer zero, heap-based traversal, filter-aware candidate admission, exact
   reranking, and explicit full-build versus incremental-generation evidence.

Both carry a `ProjectionStamp` with contract version, identity, configuration
digest, artifact digest, generation, source cursor, and lifecycle state. The
unified `VectorCatalog` publishes with compare-and-swap revision control,
advances generations exactly once, moves replaced artifacts to `retiring`,
quarantines only the active ready generation, and reclaims retired digests only
when no supplied `(projection id, generation)` pin protects them.

`VectorRuntime` is the in-process coordinator. It plans from the current catalog
and then rechecks the selected artifact against the exact published descriptor
before execution. `Exact` never selects HNSW. A post-generation vector delta no
longer makes the graph unusable: insertion, update, and retirement versions are
searched exactly beside HNSW candidates and share final exact visibility,
filtering, scoring, and ordering. The plan records the immutable base cursor,
overlay cursor, and delta count. `RequireApproximate` therefore keeps the graph
path while new authoritative data is immediately visible; `AllowApproximate`
may still choose a cheaper exact scan. Highly selective filters raise estimated
graph cost because traversal needs non-matching navigation nodes.

For unchanged configuration, maintenance inserts only versions after the
active generation's source cursor. It builds a new immutable graph while the
old generation remains readable, then publishes object bytes and the catalogue
record with one CAS. Authoritative transactions and searches do not wait for
that publication. Configuration changes deliberately perform a full build.

The in-process coordinator is not durable truth. Node publication explicitly
records the artifact codec (`exact_segment`, `compact_dense`, or `hnsw`), stages
its content-addressed bytes, and then commits a strict `vector_artifact` record
with the verified object reference in one `RRD storage coordinator` transaction. Only a
successful commit replaces the serving view. Restart reconstructs catalog
revision order from the typed log, proves record and object shared a commit,
loads verified bytes through the object port, decodes the declared codec, and
requires exact descriptor equality. Revision gaps, stale publishers, missing
objects, digest/length differences, and codec substitution fail closed.
Connectome exposes the bounded catalog metadata and receipts without raw vector
payloads.

## Evidence

Reproduce the retained fixed-seed profile with:

```bash
cargo run --locked --release -q -p rrd-vector \
  --example vector_evidence -- 10000 128 25
```

Retained raw output:
[`evidence/m5-vector-local-10000x128.json`](evidence/m5-vector-local-10000x128.json).
The run used rustc 1.95.0 on an 8-vCPU Intel Xeon E5-2699 v4 KVM guest. Timing
is a single local observation, not a cross-machine performance claim.

| Filter | `ef` | Recall@10 | exact ms | HNSW ms | planner |
|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| 100% | 64 | 0.664 | 23.38 | 2.18 | HNSW |
| 100% | 128 | 0.892 | 24.56 | 4.10 | HNSW |
| 100% | 256 | 0.980 | 23.46 | 5.91 | HNSW |
| 50% | 128 | 0.972 | 20.27 | 6.22 | HNSW |
| 10% | 64 | 0.992 | 16.08 | 8.55 | HNSW |
| 10% | 256 | 1.000 | 16.12 | 18.09 | exact scan |
| 1% | 32 | 1.000 | 15.42 | 19.49 | exact scan |
| 1% | 128 | 1.000 | 15.81 | 44.65 | exact scan |

The same run observed:

- 18.94 s deterministic HNSW construction;
- 19,971,560 artifact bytes for 5,120,000 raw f32 payload bytes (3.90×);
- 19,764 KiB RSS before build, 90,060 KiB after reopen, and 130,348 KiB
  high-water RSS while old and reopened generations overlapped;
- experimental per-vector symmetric int8 payload at 25.78% of raw f32 size,
  mean absolute cosine-score error 0.000274, and 1.0 recall@10 after exact
  reranking 64 candidates.

The deterministic test matrix additionally covers an independent scalar exact
oracle, Memory/Fjall/native log differential, and 512-vector fixed corpora for
cosine, dot, Euclidean, and Manhattan at 100%, 50%, 10%, and 1% selectivity.
Scalar and runtime-dispatched AVX2 HNSW results are identical and mean
Recall@10 is at least 0.95 in every cell with `ef=128`. Separate tests cover
nested filter algebra, corrupt/stale denial, immediate insertion/retirement
overlays, and eight incremental generations of mixed updates and valid-time
deletes with deterministic byte reopen and catalogue replacement.

## M6 extension

M6 adds a compact exact dense format with mmap reads, scalar/AVX2 differential,
model-bound requests/projections, and strict accelerator-build admission. See
[`rrd-inference-edge.md`](rrd-inference-edge.md). The JSON segment remains
the portable M5 semantic fixture, while the compact format is the production
dense payload direction.

## Honest boundary

This establishes the local M5 semantic and measurement baseline. It does not
establish superiority over Qdrant or any other vector database.

- HNSW currently accelerates only dense vectors; sparse and multi-vector ANN
  remain exact-only.
- Scalar, product 4×–64×, binary, and TurboQuant 4/2/1.5/1-bit codecs are
  planner-visible only through the shared authenticated lifecycle documented in
  [`rrd-quantization-lifecycle-v1.md`](rrd-quantization-lifecycle-v1.md).
  Build/list/activate/retire, exact-stamp CAS, immutable object binding,
  checksummed owned/mmap reopen, corruption denial, SIMD/scalar differential,
  update/rebuild/recovery, and exact-f32 reranking pass locally. The standalone
  `ScalarQuantizedVector` remains a reference primitive rather than a second
  lifecycle.
- HNSW graph artifacts remain canonical JSON and storage-heavy. Dense exact
  payloads have a compact mmap representation; compact graph and payload-bitmap
  layouts, ACORN-style payload-derived edges, and automatic merge thresholds
  remain open.
- Scalar and AVX2 HNSW and exact kernels exist. The GPU boundary verifies adapter output,
  but no physical GPU adapter, shard replication, or live cross-system
  benchmark is certified yet.
- Recall depends strongly on dimension, corpus, graph parameters, filter
  selectivity, and `ef`. The low-`ef` rows are intentionally retained so the
  project cannot hide that quality/latency tradeoff.

Cross-system Qdrant proof remains a separate fixed-hardware protocol after the
remaining production paths are ready.

## Quantization implementation and remaining promotion gate

The primary contract is Zandieh et al.,
[“TurboQuant: Online Vector Quantization with Near-optimal Distortion Rate”](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19874)
(ICLR 2026). The landed MSE variant has frozen deterministic tests for
normalization/norm retention, seeded rotation, fixed distribution-matched
centroids at every supported bit width, packed-code decoding, asymmetric
scoring, authenticated artifact reopen/corruption denial, planner selection,
and exact reranking. It deliberately does not claim the paper's residual QJL
estimator. Exact f32 vectors remain authoritative for quality measurement and
final reranking.

The local 512×64 matrix reports packed/full/auxiliary/total bytes, build and
automatic-kernel search time, mean absolute score error, Recall@10 after exact
reranking, mmap reopen, and scalar/runtime-dispatched SIMD parity for every
supported scalar/product/binary/TurboQuant row. Engine integration separately
proves authenticated lifecycle denial, update, recovery, and exact truth.
Product promotion still requires larger fixed-hardware corpora, filtered
p50/p95/p99 service measurements, distributed placement, physical memory-tier
policy, and GPU qualification. The paper's residual QJL estimator is not
implemented. This remains an engine-alpha capability, not a Qdrant-equivalence
or superiority claim.
