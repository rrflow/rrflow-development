# Anytype-inspired connectome workbench

Research date: 2026-08-18. This is an interaction study, not a proposal to
copy Anytype's branding or source.

## Patterns worth adopting

| Anytype pattern | Connectome translation |
|---|---|
| Objects accumulate properties and relationships | Claims, runs, evidence, files, and invocations are inspectable objects with stable identities |
| A Channel/Space owns its objects and sidebar | One RRFlow project instance owns its runtime state and navigation; estate navigation may select among instances without merging their authority |
| Sidebar widgets provide persistent lenses | Estates, Tables, Data models, and Visuals are stable operator workspaces; the deeper runtime labs remain directly reachable |
| Types, Queries, and Collections can render through different Views | The same runtime snapshot can render as graph, timeline, table, route result, or inspector |
| Global and local graph navigation | Global instance map exists, but local selection-centered graphs are the default |
| Desktop frontend is separated from local middleware | The workbench is a browser UI over a local read-only Rust API; the store remains authoritative |
| Graph rendering moves expensive simulation off the main UI path | Start with bounded SVG for runtime-sized snapshots; retain a worker/WebGL migration boundary when measurements require it |
| Selecting one object recenters its local relationships and properties | A frozen micro-event becomes the focused object while typed context, model, tool, and outcome lanes preserve its surrounding sequence |
| Composable blocks keep dense object data explorable | The flight stage, transport, event envelope, baseline, and inspector remain independently inspectable surfaces over one authoritative record |

## Corrections for a frontier-runtime tool

An undifferentiated knowledge graph becomes decorative at scale. Connectome's
default graph therefore centers on the selected run, claim, evidence item, or
file. Edge labels remain visible and filters operate on runtime semantics, not
just colors. The global view is an optional orientation mode.

The workbench is initially read-only. Reasoning and mutation gates remain on
the existing typed lifecycle surfaces; a visual button must not become a path
around policy. Later controls should call the same commands and expose their
contract differential before execution.

## Current information architecture

```text
instance sidebar          active lens                         inspector
├─ Overview               health + active run                selected object
├─ Estates                boundary + node topology            instance/sample
├─ Tables                 logical catalog + row preview       row identity
├─ Data models            scoped type/relationship map        schema contract
├─ Visuals                one active evidence visual          frozen event
├─ Visual labs            flight/stream/trace/graph/cluster   raw evidence
└─ Developer tools        query/run/claim/route/activity       plan/provenance
```

The top command field searches across all loaded objects and doubles as the
route query in the Routes lens. Keyboard navigation is first-class: `/` focuses
search; `t`, `g`, `r`, `c`, and `a` open the main lenses.

## Implemented workbench

The `connectome` binary serves embedded HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from the same
local Rust process as its instance-bound API. It currently provides:

- typed estate, table-catalog, and scoped-model snapshot projections;
- a local estate topology with explicit store/member binding and an unattached
  cloud-control boundary;
- logical table browsing that identifies authoritative, projected, catalog,
  and bounded-log surfaces before showing rows;
- multi-scope data-model navigation with relationship paths and the full
  persisted enforcement contract;
- a visual observatory over real committed events plus direct entry into one
  full-depth visual lab at a time;
- runtime health and freshness overview;
- selection-centered and global object graphs with semantic filters;
- claims, reasoning transitions, and evidence as first-class graph objects;
- current-claim inspection including validity, producer, and SHA-256 identity;
- reasoning-run timelines;
- ranked full-file source routes with visible justification;
- invocation activity and outcomes;
- stable hash routes and keyboard navigation.
- controlled prompt flights across fresh, pruned, and full context arms;
- live event playback with pause, step, scrub, stage jumps, and raw inspection;
- a one-run reasoning lab with exact `medium`/`high`/`xhigh`/`max` effort
  controls and explicit observable-only boundaries;
- aligned event-mass lanes for context, model envelopes, tools, and outcomes,
  with click-to-freeze packets and complete captured-envelope expansion;
- a bounded global temporal stream over persisted reasoning, routing, workflow,
  model/flight, search, storage, and data mutations, with first/rewind/play/
  forward/latest controls and mutation-plus-audit inspection;
- same-prompt baseline comparison for context, provider tokens, tools, latency,
  and acceptance.

The transport verifies the instance/store pairing and accepts writes only for
the explicit prompt-flight endpoint. Frontier runners are disabled by default,
run with read-only/plan-mode permissions when enabled, and never receive a
shell-interpolated prompt. The server binds to loopback by default and requires
an explicit warning-bearing override for remote binding.

## Evolution path

1. Replace five-second full snapshots with sequence-cursor runtime deltas. The
   global temporal stream is already cursor-ordered but is delivered as the
   newest bounded snapshot; flight events use a separate 750 ms lightweight
   feed.
2. Add saved, instance-specific lenses without turning those preferences into
   authoritative runtime truth.
3. Move graph layout/rendering to a worker and WebGL only after node-count and
   frame-time measurements justify it.
4. Keep provider execution read-only until operator actions can cross the
   existing lifecycle/policy contract and show the differential before
   confirmation.
5. Add estate-level multi-instance navigation only after every query and
   visualization carries exact project, environment, and instance scope.

Current browser acceptance belongs to the standalone Connectome repository:

```bash
cd ../connectome
pnpm run test:smoke
```
