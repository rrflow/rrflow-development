# RRD Rust client v1

Status: asynchronous local-daemon plus experimental remote-mTLS client walking
skeleton implemented against the entire currently published RRD operation catalogue.
Distributed qualification, generated API reference, and a released-version
matrix remain open.

`rrd-client` is the first supported-client boundary. It depends on
`rrd-contract` and HTTP transport crates, never on RRFlow storage, RRFlowQL/RRD query executor,
RRD server, estate, or security internals. Server/security dependencies are
dev-only black-box fixtures.

## Transport and protocol invariants

- Plain HTTP construction accepts only an explicit loopback socket. Remote
  construction requires an HTTPS origin and caller-supplied Rustls client
  identity/trust configuration; the server still requires mTLS and application
  authorization.
- Capability and endpoint-catalogue calls validate protocol identity/version,
  capability ordering, and exact instance identity.
- Every envelope is constructed from public resource and correlation types and
  validated before network I/O.
- Every response must agree across HTTP status and typed outcome, use protocol
  v1, and echo request/operation identity for envelope calls.
- Response accumulation is capped at four MiB while frames are read; a declared
  timeout and optional absolute request deadline bound each attempt.
- Dropping the async future cancels client-side waiting. Deadline expiration is
  detected before an attempt.
- Reads and idempotency-bound mutations retry only transport loss/timeout, at
  most the configured 1–8 attempts. API responses are never blindly replayed.
- API-key and bearer values exist only in request headers and are not included
  in typed errors.

## Current typed surface

The client covers capability, endpoint, and OpenAPI negotiation; session create/renew/
close; transaction begin/preview/commit/abort; RRFlowQL query; vector search;
changefeed read/follow; durable subscription open/connect/receive/ACK/heartbeat/
close over `ws://` or mTLS `wss://`; backup create/list/restore; estate read;
and audit read.
`RequestOptions` makes correlation, deadline, and mutation idempotency explicit.
Transaction preview is a mutation-idempotent durable prepare and returns the
complete prospective all-model snapshot without publishing it.
API errors retain stable `ErrorCode`, message, retryability and HTTP status.

## Black-box evidence

The hermetic test starts a secured real RRD server, places a TCP fault proxy in
front of it, drops the first connection, and proves capability negotiation
recovers within the configured attempt bound. It then proves endpoint-catalogue
decoding, typed wrong-key error mapping, principal session creation, exact query
results, client-side expired-deadline denial, transaction begin/preview/abort,
retained changefeed decoding, durable WebSocket push/reconnect replay, protected
audit decoding, and cleartext remote endpoint denial. A second live fixture
proves valid mTLS HTTP and WebSocket negotiation, the current TLS-derived
capability label, missing-client-certificate denial, and wrong-server-name
denial. The loopback client currently requires `local_daemon` and the mTLS
client currently requires `remote`; those are conflicting pre-release labels,
not the accepted profile classification. Both commit and query the same narrow
checked-in seed corpus. Their direct convergence and complete proof boundary
are defined by the
[deployment-profile reference](reference/deployment/modes.md).
The complementary real-server fault row drops a data-commit response, restarts
the process on the same root, and proves the ordinary idempotent retry returns
the durable receipt without duplicating any runtime change.

This is not the F5 exit gate. Commit and vector mutations, renewal/closure,
backup/restore, estate projection, response-limit
faults, server-version mismatches, and released package compatibility need
additional black-box rows. TypeScript, Python, Go, Java and .NET clients must
then pass the same semantic fixture.
