# Current alpha objective and remediation

**Status:** active canonical RRFlow 1.0 roadmap chapter
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/roadmap/rrflow-1.0/current-alpha-objective-and-remediation`
**Owner:** [RRFlow 1.0 release roadmap](../rrflow-1.0.md)

This chapter is part of the canonical RRFlow 1.0 roadmap. The parent
record owns release order and completion status; this file cannot change
either independently.

The [parent roadmap](../rrflow-1.0.md) and its linked chapters form the single
detailed RRFlow 1.0 execution record. The repository root
[README](../../../README.md) is the bootstrap knowledge map and owns product
identity and current status. Supporting design, research, and evidence records
may inform this roadmap but cannot silently change its gates or completion.

The [RRFlow 1.0 alpha objective](../../objectives/rrflow-1.0-alpha.md) owns the
measurable outcome and its current evidence classification. The
[RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M](../../poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha.md) owns verified deficiencies
and maps each one back to the linked gate chapters. The
[system overview](../../architecture/system-overview.md) owns the canonical
component and security-boundary map, and the
[engine data-flow record](../../architecture/engine-data-flow.md) owns the detailed
transactional, storage, Arrow, DataFusion, and context flow. This roadmap owns
only dependency order, checkboxes, and accepted completion evidence.

The supporting [RRFlow 1.0 code execution map](../rrflow-1.0-execution-map.md)
binds the unchecked gates to current files, symbols, planned paths, commands,
and stop conditions. Its generated
[file plan](../rrflow-1.0-file-plan.jsonl) covers the complete repository
baseline. Neither supporting record may change the completion ledger here.

Roadmap completion currently stands at:

| Gate | Purpose | Complete |
|---|---|---:|
| A | authority, naming, documentation memory, and repository-contained source boundaries | 7 / 7 |
| B | public, install, routing, model, WebSocket, and GraphQL contracts | 5 / 5 |
| C | sole hybrid persistent rrflowKV substrate | 6 / 7 |
| D | per-project install, operation, repair, configuration, and attunement | 0 / 11 |
| E | native graph, scalar, BM25, and vector access paths | 0 / 5 |
| F | streamed Arrow/DataFusion analytical execution | 0 / 5 |
| G | LFG routing through the engine | 0 / 6 |
| H | dynamic context, feedback, delivery, tracing, and Connectome | 0 / 7 |
| I | explicit engine events, triggers, routines, host-event adapters, and skills | 0 / 7 |
| J | self-contained release and real deployment proof | 0 / 5 |
