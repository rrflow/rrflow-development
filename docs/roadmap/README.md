# RRFlow roadmaps

**Status:** active roadmap index
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/roadmap-index/rrflow-roadmaps`
**Owner:** roadmap discovery; linked from `docs/README.md`

A roadmap records ordered delivery outcomes and acceptance evidence. It links
to architecture and decisions but does not redefine them.

The current [alpha objective](../objectives/rrflow-1.0-alpha.md) defines the
result. The current [POA&M](../poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha.md) tracks verified gaps
against the roadmap gates.

The canonical RRFlow 1.0 roadmap's links-only
[chapter index](rrflow-1.0/) provides direct warp points to its checklist,
dependency spine, gate requirements, and accepted evidence.

The canonical roadmap is accompanied by a subordinate
[code execution map](rrflow-1.0-execution-map.md) and its generated
[whole-repository file plan](rrflow-1.0-file-plan.jsonl). These records map
files, symbols, tests, and stop conditions; they cannot change checklist status.
The completed C-06j work is recorded by the
[scan-resistant cache integration plan](c06j-rrflowkv-scan-resistant-cache-engineering-plan.md).
It specifies a configurable exact-byte production cache and a real persisted
mixed-family differential. The canonical roadmap accepts C-06 from the complete
C-06a-through-C-06j evidence corpus; D-01 is now active.
The completed C-06i compression slice is bound by the
[adaptive page-compression plan](c06i-rrflowkv-adaptive-page-compression-engineering-plan.md).
It specifies a direct segment-v6 replacement with authenticated per-page
adaptive LZ4, bounded decode, explicit ownership, and integrated evidence. The
completed
[persisted-filter integration plan](c06i-rrflowkv-persisted-filter-integration-engineering-plan.md)
records the direct segment-v4-to-v5 replacement and first selected production
policy. The completed
[physical-policy selection plan](c06i-rrflowkv-physical-policy-selection-engineering-plan.md)
remains the measured input; C-06j resolves the cache decision and rejects value
placement for the accepted format. The completed C-06h
[adversarial qualification plan](c06h-rrflowkv-adversarial-qualification-engineering-plan.md)
and C-06g
[projected-read plan](c06g-rrflowkv-projected-read-engineering-plan.md) remain
supporting history. None can change canonical dependency order or completion
status.
