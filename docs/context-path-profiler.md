# Context path profiler concept

Status: historical product concept. It is not a current standalone-repository,
engine-event, or Connectome implementation decision; `README.md` owns those
boundaries and their release order.

## Product gap

Existing products already visualize model, tool, and retrieval spans:
[LangSmith](https://docs.langchain.com/oss/python/langchain/observability),
[Phoenix](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix/tracing/llm-traces), and
[Sourcegraph Cody](https://sourcegraph.com/docs/cody/core-concepts/context) are
useful references. Claude Code exposes context-window composition and
compaction through its
[`/context` tooling](https://code.claude.com/docs/en/context-window), while
[Cursor](https://docs.cursor.com/en/guides/working-with-context) documents its
rules, memories, and context sources.

The proposed tool is not another generic trace tree. Its differentiated job is
to explain, in plain language, how a prompt traversed a project's context
architecture and whether that path helped the verified outcome:

```text
prompt -> harness instructions -> routed .md files -> searches and reads
       -> injected/evicted context -> tool actions -> verification -> outcome
```

It should expose repeated searches, missed canonical documents, conflicting
instructions, stale routes, duplicate context, expensive hops, compaction loss,
and successful paths that ought to become the single source of truth.

## Historical proposed event contract

Every adapter emits provider-neutral, append-only events with a run ID, span
and parent IDs, monotonic ordinal, wall/monotonic time, actor, project identity,
content digest, provenance, token/byte estimates, latency, and policy labels.
Typed event families cover:

- prompt accepted and reasoning profile requested;
- instruction discovered, selected, rejected, or superseded;
- file/search/context read with route and relevance evidence;
- context injected, cached, evicted, compacted, or reconstructed;
- model, tool, and sub-agent attempt plus observation;
- decision, verification, regression, and final outcome;
- proposed documentation consolidation, approval, application, and rollback.

Raw provider events remain immutable. RRFlow stores the temporal log and derived
graph/time-series projections; it does not pretend a projection is canonical.
OpenTelemetry/OpenInference ingestion and native Claude, Codex, local-model,
Automaton, and later LFG adapters all lower into this contract.

## Connectome experience

The default view is a one-run-at-a-time animated path graph that a non-expert
can understand. It supports pause, freeze, step, rewind, fast-forward, and
micro-event expansion without changing canonical data. A weak-prompt and
strong-prompt demo use the same project and outcome rubric so their paths can
be overlaid rather than presented as decorative animation.

Operator views add:

- a synchronized event timeline, graph, context-window meter, and token/latency
  attribution;
- SSOT conflict and duplicate-document heat maps;
- prompt-to-file route coverage, repeated-search loops, and dead-end paths;
- before/after run comparison with verified outcome and regression evidence;
- protected, active, stale, redundant, and deletion-candidate context states;
- direct expansion from an aggregate edge into the exact immutable events.

The UI never invents hidden chain-of-thought. It visualizes observable harness,
context, tool, storage, timing, and verification events plus explicitly labeled
inferences.

## Evidence-gated pruning

The suggested default is a 90-day review cadence. A 50–80% reduction is a
configurable optimization hypothesis, not a deletion quota. Canonical
decisions, security policy, active routes, legal/audit retention, and material
needed by successful replays are protected by default.

Pruning follows a reversible transaction:

1. inventory and classify context with provenance and last-use evidence;
2. propose merges, rewrites, routing changes, archive moves, and removals;
3. replay representative weak/strong prompts against the candidate snapshot;
4. deny when success, latency, tokens, or policy behavior regress;
5. require configured human approval, commit atomically, and retain rollback;
6. grow from the consolidated SSOT rather than recreating parallel notes.

Clyffy can later enforce this lifecycle, while LFG compiles the selected
context into the just-in-time model input. RRFlow provides durable memory and
time travel; neither component is allowed to silently rewrite operator truth.

## Historical proposed delivery gates

1. Freeze the event schema and ingest one Claude/Codex-compatible trace.
2. Prove deterministic replay and time travel over RRFlow.
3. Ship the weak/strong prompt comparison and path/SSOT diagnostics locally.
4. Validate metric attribution against raw traces and known documentation
   faults in multiple repositories.
5. Add evidence-gated consolidation with approval and rollback.
6. Integrate LFG/Automaton/Clyffy only after the standalone profiler is useful.
7. Publish after privacy, secret-redaction, export, and benchmark gates pass.

## Naming caution

The capability is worth building, but the RRFlow name has search and product
collisions: an existing [RR Flow](https://rrflow.com.br/) network platform and
multiple `rflow` AI/research brands already exist. A low-cost defensive domain
may be reasonable, but domain purchase should follow trademark and exact-name
checks rather than being treated as product validation.
