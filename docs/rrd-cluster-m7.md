# RRD cluster contract and deterministic simulation

Status: protocol/simulation, real-consensus adapter, authenticated transport,
and one-host process-isolation gates implemented on 2026-08-19. This is not a
production Multi-AZ implementation.

## Outcome

`rrd-cluster` freezes the cluster semantics that production adapters must
preserve before RRFlow adds networking or a consensus library:

- canonical, epoch-bound shard placement with unique ordered replicas;
- odd voter sets, quorum math, and explicit availability-zone constraints;
- `linearizable`, `bounded_stale`, and `exact_snapshot` read requests;
- quorum-durable writes as the only M7 write mode;
- per-shard stamps containing term, commit index, placement epoch, and state
  digest;
- snapshot vectors that retain their real partial order instead of inventing a
  total cluster cursor;
- route evidence containing requested consistency, selected replicas, health,
  observed stamp, and an allow/deny reason;
- grounded snapshot-plus-contiguous-WAL replica transfer;
- metadata-indexed reshard plans with exact cutover vectors; and
- fail-closed cross-shard writes until durable intents, recovery, idempotency,
  and a verified commit protocol exist.

The reserved metadata shard is shard `0`. A production control plane must put
placement and reshard transitions through the same quorum-durable ordered log;
an in-memory placement map is not linearizable metadata.

## Real-consensus adapter slice

The optional `openraft-adapter` feature pins OpenRaft `0.9.25` and keeps Tokio,
OpenRaft, and native storage out of the default protocol/simulator build. The
pin is deliberate: `0.9.25` is the current stable line and includes upstream
commit-safety and membership-divergence corrections, while the `0.10` line is
still alpha. The reviewed upstream tag resolves to commit
`8815cdba2826f74e848acef361ad03f93bb1c3f8`.

Selection matrix:

| Candidate | Decision | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| OpenRaft 0.9.25 | Adopt behind a feature | Application-neutral log, state-machine, snapshot, and network ports; storage conformance suite; stable release line |
| OpenRaft 0.10 alpha | Reject for this gate | Alpha API/behavior is not the right persistence-format dependency |
| TiKV `raft-rs` | Defer, retain as a design reference | Strong production lineage, but lower-level integration and readiness driving would add more RRFlow-owned consensus plumbing before this contract is proved |

The RRFlow adapter format is now `v4`. It supplies:

- a canonical command/response/node `RaftTypeConfig` with typed
  `placement_transition`, `probe`, and `runtime_commit` operations;
- a store permanently bound to one shard and two explicit physical domains:
  canonical state at the instance root and node-local Raft state under
  `raft-local-v4`;
- authoritative RRD LSM batches for node-local votes, committed/purged pointers,
  and ordered logs, without placing those records in transferable state;
- monotonic vote persistence and append-batch hole rejection;
- full-command idempotency, payload integrity, shard binding, explicit
  placement-epoch transitions, and optional expected-commit-index comparison;
- epoch 1 initialization and exact-successor advance bound to the currently
  applied OpenRaft voter canonical ids/zones; ordinary work fails closed before
  initialization, at another epoch, or after voter identity/zone changes until
  a new matching epoch is committed; learner-only metadata does not invalidate
  a valid binding;
- deterministic request-response retention across exactly the latest 4,096
  applied-log positions, while canonical runtime content identity remains
  independently durable;
- native `RuntimeCommit` planning without publication, allowing canonical
  runtime mutations, audit/outbox work, the Raft applied cursor, response, and
  idempotency state to share one authoritative RRD LSM WAL frame;
- digest-chained application state and metadata-checked physical snapshot
  installation;
- snapshot-bundle v1 export/install carrying the applied cursor, membership,
  request identities, schema, audit/outbox, and every canonical runtime record;
- a file-backed OpenRaft `SnapshotData` path with a hard 1 GiB write bound,
  64 KiB export/object buffers, one-segment-at-a-time deep validation, and
  ephemeral build/receive spool cleanup;
- a content-addressed local snapshot object plus a small local RRD LSM reference,
  preventing recursive bundles and avoiding the 8 MiB value ceiling;
- the complete upstream OpenRaft storage conformance suite; and
- a real four-node in-process engine test that elects a leader, commits
  commands, purges snapshotted logs, catches up a new learner through snapshot
  transfer, isolates the leader, elects on the majority side, commits after
  failover, and completes joint-to-uniform membership replacement.

A real canonical `RuntimeCommit` run waits for three voters to apply the same
truth, builds an authenticated physical snapshot, purges the leader through
that snapshot, and adds a fourth node. The fresh learner receives the snapshot,
reopens through `NativeEngine`, and exposes the same commit identity and cursor
as all voters. Storage differentials additionally prove same-frame
Raft/runtime publication, duplicate replay without a second runtime mutation,
durable expected-cursor denial, corrupt-byte and forged-metadata refusal before
state publication, idempotent reinstallation, stale refusal, restart recovery,
preservation of the target node's local vote, placement initialization and
successor ordering, voter-binding mismatch/churn denial and rebinding, and the
exact request retention boundary.

Snapshot data is exactly RRD LSM physical snapshot-bundle v1: a flush-bounded,
SHA-256-authenticated manifest and immutable-segment closure installed through
one new local manifest publication. Before installation the adapter reads the
state config and state-machine record directly from the validated closure,
checks shard/domain ownership, binds OpenRaft metadata and snapshot id, and
refuses any local-Raft config in the bundle. Source manifest ancestry is never
adopted. Snapshot cache bytes live in the node-local content-addressed object
tier; only their verified reference is stored beside local Raft history.

### File-backed snapshot lifecycle

Snapshot construction, receipt, installation, cache publication, and cache
reopen no longer materialize the complete bundle as `Cursor<Vec<u8>>`.
`RRFlowSnapshotData` wraps a seekable Tokio file, rejects a write that would cross
the shared 1 GiB physical limit, and removes ephemeral build/receive files on
drop. `RRFlowRaftStore::open` also removes abandoned regular spool files left by a
crashed process and refuses ambiguous non-file entries. Durable cached snapshot
objects opt out of deletion and are reopened only after streaming object digest
and length verification.

`SnapshotBundleFile` writes the unchanged bundle-v1 wire format directly from
immutable segment files with a 64 KiB copy/hash buffer. Open validates the outer
digest, bounded manifest/descriptors, exact segment inventory, and each physical
segment one at a time. Installation similarly admits only one transferred
segment at a time before native RRD LSM opens the installed image.
OpenRaft's default chunk transport then reads the seekable file in bounded
chunks; RRFlow's JSON/TLS envelope retains its independent 16 MiB frame bound.

Executable evidence includes deterministic current bundle bytes plus backward
read compatibility with the checked-in bundle-v1/segment-v2 fixture,
corrupt/truncated denial, idempotent install and durable-cache reopen,
post-purge learner catch-up in both in-process and four-process runs, 1 GiB
write refusal before I/O, abandoned-spool restart cleanup, and crash/storage-full
injection after header write, segment write, and file sync. A Linux regression
fixture exports a bundle larger than 16 MiB while requiring incremental RSS
growth to remain at or below 16 MiB. This proves snapshot overhead is not
proportional to the whole bundle for that fixture. Segment v3 separately keeps
the installed immutable image disk-resident behind a database-wide bounded
decoded-block cache; transfer and query residency therefore have separate
executable RSS bounds.

## Authenticated transport v2

The separate `openraft-transport` feature adds real TCP transport without
putting async, TLS, or X.509 dependencies in the default contract/simulator or
storage-only adapter. It uses rustls/Tokio-rustls and deliberately enables only
TLS 1.3. Every connection requires a CA-validated client certificate and a
CA-validated server certificate. The leaf must contain exactly one SPIFFE-style
URI SAN derived from a configured trust domain plus canonical digests of the
cluster and node ids; DNS/IP endpoint validation still runs independently.

Transport envelope v2 additionally binds the protocol version, cluster, shard,
numeric and canonical source/target identities, serialized request digest, and
the source carried inside the OpenRaft vote. A static authorization map prevents
a trusted certificate from relabeling itself as another numeric Raft node.
The v2 envelope also carries one narrowly typed internal `RuntimeCommit` RPC.
It accepts only the configured project scope, validates the canonical command,
and follows the current leader through the same authenticated node map; it is
not a general administrative or cross-project write endpoint.
Frames are rejected above 16 MiB before allocation, client work honors
OpenRaft's hard TTL, ingress work has a 30-second lifetime, and the listener
admits at most 256 concurrent RPCs. One RPC is sent per TLS connection; no
bearer credential or TLS early-data path exists. Consensus-level duplicate and
replay handling remains OpenRaft's responsibility rather than a second ordering
protocol in the transport.

A four-node real-TCP loopback test elects three voters, commits an explicit
placement and probe, snapshots and purges the leader log, and catches up a fresh
learner through OpenRaft's chunked snapshot RPC. It also proves denial when a
trusted node certificate is paired with another node's envelope and when an
authenticated node sends a vote naming a different Raft source. This proves the
wire/authentication contract, not independent hosts or production operations.

This is stronger evidence than the single-term simulator, but the two tests
serve different purposes. The simulator gives replayable schedules for explicit
fault events; the in-process test exercises the real consensus engine and
durable adapter. The latter uses a controlled wall-clock lease wait and is not
represented as deterministic virtual-time model checking.

## Process-isolated node evidence

The feature-gated `rrd-cluster-node` executable is the first deployable process
boundary. It opens one shard's durable RRD LSM domains, verifies that its own
leaf certificate's exact SPIFFE URI matches the configured canonical node before
emitting readiness, and then serves the authenticated OpenRaft transport. Node
configuration and TLS inputs are size bounded. Lifecycle control is a versioned,
request-correlated JSON-lines contract over inherited stdin/stdout, not a public
unauthenticated admin listener. Unknown envelope fields, unsupported versions,
invalid request identities, empty frames, and frames above 1 MiB fail closed;
oversized input is drained only to the next newline without unbounded allocation.
Config v2 requires one project scope and accepts a bounded transport-admission
policy. Control v4 adds typed `RuntimeCommit` submission, rejects commits for
any other scope before Raft submission, and returns reset-explicit operational
telemetry with exact project/cluster/shard/node coordinates in node status.

A black-box integration run owns four child processes and four independent data
roots. It:

1. forms three voters, commits placement, application probes, and a
   project-scoped vector-artifact reference, rejects a foreign-scope runtime
   commit, abruptly kills a voter, commits with quorum, restarts that voter,
   and waits for catch-up;
2. abruptly kills the leader, elects another voter, and commits after the
   leadership no-op is durably applied;
3. disables both ingress and egress at the live leader's transport boundary,
   elects and commits on the majority side, heals the partition, and proves the
   isolated process advances to at least the committed index;
4. snapshots and purges every voter so a leadership change cannot bypass
   recovery through an unpurged log, starts the fourth process as a learner,
   and proves its applied state, persisted snapshot cursor, artifact bytes,
   authenticated manifest, terminal transfer receipt, and consensus-applied
   transfer trace tail;
5. denies readiness when a node-four config is paired with node three's trusted
   leaf; and
6. shuts down the learner, corrupts its RRD LSM `CURRENT` pointer, and proves
   restart refuses readiness with an error.

The complete scenario passes five consecutive stress repetitions. It also
exposed and corrected an exact-equality wait race: supervisor `wait_applied`
now means monotonic “at least,” so a follower that advances beyond the requested
index cannot falsely time out.

This is deliberately scoped evidence. The processes share one host and loopback
network; the transport gate is controlled fault injection, not a kernel/network
appliance; and the corrupted object is one authenticated pointer, not an
exhaustive disk/controller fault campaign.

## Credential lifecycle v1

Transport credentials are no longer permanently captured when a node starts.
`RRFlowTlsReloader` owns a complete immutable leaf/key/trust-root/CRL state and an
exact-successor process-local generation. A replacement validates the leaf's
canonical SPIFFE identity and key before one write-lock publication. Every new
outbound RPC obtains a client config from the latest state and every accepted
connection obtains a server config from that same state; an already established
one-request connection may finish, but no later connection can reuse the old
state. Stale or concurrent generation updates fail closed.

When CRLs are present, both client and server WebPKI verification checks the end
entity, denies unknown revocation status, and enforces CRL expiration. Root
rotation therefore supplies the complete root and CRL set for every active
issuer: introduce old+new roots and both CRLs, rotate leaves, then publish only
the new root and its CRL. An RPC envelope generation was deliberately rejected
as a revocation mechanism because a compromised leaf could lie about that
unenforced number; revocation remains cryptographic.

The real-TCP test proves uninterrupted Raft replication after a leaf hot swap,
stale local generation denial, CRL denial of an otherwise CA-valid leaf,
two-root overlap, migration of every node to a second CA, removal of the first
CA, continued quorum writes, and denial of a leaf signed by the retired CA. The
four-process test rotates the active identities, distributes a CRL revoking node
one's original leaf, crashes and restarts nodes, proves the restarted stale leaf
cannot catch up, reapplies the latest complete file set, then proceeds through
live partition/heal and snapshot catch-up.

This design follows the SPIFFE Workload API's full-set streaming model: updates
replace the entire SVID/bundle/CRL view and can be pushed on rotation or CRL
change. The current implementation accepts bounded DER files from the inherited
supervisor protocol; it does not yet connect to a Workload API socket or persist
an external issuer generation. On restart, the supervisor must replay the latest
full set, and peers' retained CRLs prevent a stale leaf from silently rejoining.

## Why this differs from the comparison systems

Current SurrealDB documentation exposes a consistent query layer over several
storage engines and describes SurrealDS as a separate quorum-based distributed
engine. Its public architecture is useful evidence for keeping compute and
storage contracts separate, but it does not provide enough public protocol
detail to substitute for a RRFlow fault model.

Qdrant uses Raft for cluster metadata, while point writes use separately
configurable replication, write consistency, read consistency, and ordering.
That is appropriate for its availability/throughput priorities. RRFlow cannot
adopt weaker point-write defaults for the authoritative reasoning/runtime log:
the initial RRFlow cluster contract requires a durable per-shard quorum before an
acknowledgement and denies a linearizable read when the leader cannot reach
quorum.

The simulator follows two stronger engineering patterns:

- FoundationDB's deterministic single-process simulation and replayable seed;
- TiKV/CockroachDB's per-range consensus/log model, quorum durability, and
  snapshot followed by ordered log catch-up.

These are design inputs, not copied implementations or proof that RRFlow is
faster or more available.

## Deterministic fault model

`SimCluster` is a single-term, single-shard quorum model. Every message has a
monotonic identity and every fault is an explicit serializable event. A seed is
retained as evidence even though this first gate does not make random choices.
The same schedule yields byte-equivalent `SimEvidence`.

Covered events:

| Event | Modeled behavior |
|---|---|
| Partition/heal | Bidirectional link denial/restoration; blocked messages remain pending |
| Delay | A message's logical delivery tick moves forward |
| Duplicate | A new message identity carries identical content; append/ack remains idempotent |
| Reorder | The caller chooses delivery order; a follower refuses to skip a log index |
| Crash/restart | Volatile availability changes while the durable log survives |
| Clock skew | Recorded per node but never used to decide log order or commit |
| Disk loss | Durable log and applied cursor are removed; restart requires transfer |

The safety verifier rejects:

- a commit cursor beyond a replica's durable log;
- different term/content identities at the same log index; and
- loss of every durable copy of an acknowledged entry while disk failures stay
  within the placement's declared tolerance.

The model-check tests enumerate both possible first-follower quorum paths
crossed with every single disk loss in a three-voter/three-zone placement. They
also enumerate leader-minority partitions and require no acknowledgement.

## Immutable artifact closure and activation ordering

Canonical runtime snapshots contain `ObjectReference` values but intentionally
do not embed potentially large vector/index artifact bytes in the Raft log or
RRD LSM bundle. Replica recovery therefore uses a separate, versioned
`ArtifactTransferManifest` bound to one shard, placement epoch, grounded Raft
snapshot, exact project `ReadStamp`, source/target pair, sorted reference list,
and digest set. Its completion receipt retains target-local object-store
evidence without rewriting the source receipt in canonical truth.

The local object path streams through a fixed 64 KiB buffer. The real mTLS
transport uses versioned begin/chunk/complete RPCs with at most 1 MiB per
chunk, request digests, authenticated source/target binding, and an fsynced
session directory keyed by the manifest digest. Begin returns authoritative
per-object offsets, so disconnect, cancellation, and process restart resume
without trusting a caller-supplied offset. Full length and SHA-256 verification
precedes content-addressed publication; duplicate content transfers once and
already verified target bytes are reused. Completion publishes one idempotent
receipt. A failed transfer emits no completion receipt and can leave only an
fsynced partial session or harmless unreachable content-addressed bytes.

OpenRaft now performs hydration once at the full-snapshot lifecycle boundary,
outside its 200 ms per-chunk deadline, before snapshot byte zero. Every fresh
full-snapshot attempt reopens the idempotent session rather than trusting a
process-local success bit; the first snapshot chunk cannot repeat that
hydration inside the short chunk deadline. Administrative learner admission
also does not trust OpenRaft's membership-write response as catch-up evidence:
RRFlow acknowledges only while the caller remains leader and its replication
metrics prove the learner matched through the committed membership log. The
source authenticates the exact cached physical
snapshot, derives its project closure, and sends only that manifest. Ordinary
target `install_snapshot` independently scans every canonical object reference
in the received bundle and verifies local length/digest before activating
state; this safety check does not depend on the source helper. A self-consistent
manifest that omits an object is therefore denied before activation.
Missing/corrupt source bytes, corrupt target content, substitution,
length/digest mismatch, foreign project scope, and stale/forged snapshot
bindings fail closed. The success path survives reopen while preserving the
target's local vote and Raft history.

The transport emits a strict `ArtifactTransferObservation` sequence for
prepared, accepted-chunk, completed, and failed phases. A configured observer
is fail-closed. Observations carry project scope, attempt, read and grounded
snapshot coordinates, digests, offsets, duration, counts, and receipt identity;
source-local attempt ordinals remain monotonic when OpenRaft rebuilds network
clients. They never carry object bytes or raw errors. `rrd-engine` supplies a durable
adapter that maps these into one `cluster.artifact_transfer` start/finish span
with causal `cluster.artifact_chunk` annotations. The existing synchronous
wrapper retains its `object.replicate` storage child. Normalized causal traces
are tested across Memory, Fjall, and native engines and are consumable by
Connectome. The real node runtime now prepares that canonical trace commit from
one exact native read/schema snapshot and routes it to the current Raft leader.
Cursor conflicts alone retry; foreign scope, authentication, validation, or
consensus failures stay fail-closed. The four-process post-purge test proves the
same trace changes on all voters and the fresh learner and proves serialized
trace mutations contain no transferred object bytes. The direct local adapter
remains explicitly local and is not represented as a replicated commit.

The receiver reconstructs its session inventory from authenticated manifests,
partial files, state, and receipts on restart. Admission caps active sessions
and reserves the complete still-missing object closure before accepting work,
so partial progress cannot oversubscribe the receiver. A global lifecycle lock
serializes admission/GC while distinct session locks permit concurrent chunk
work. Stale incomplete sessions and completed receipts have explicit retention
and count bounds; GC validates every digest-scoped target, rejects symlinks and
unexpected entries, and deletes only transfer metadata. Completion idempotency
therefore has a documented retention window while immutable object bytes remain
content-addressed. Deterministic-clock tests cover quota refusal, stale reclaim,
restart reconstruction, receipt replay/expiry, and distinct-session concurrency.

The synchronous S3-compatible port has the same verify-before-publish
semantics and now exposes authenticated resumable multipart upload plus
version-bound ranged download. It retains one bounded part/range, reuses only
exact listed parts, conditionally completes the content address, and retries
only explicitly transient failures within a fixed attempt bound. Retained
large-closure soak, automatic telemetry collection/export, per-principal remote
admission, live endpoint certification, and independent-machine chaos remain
required before calling this production artifact replication.

## Operational telemetry and per-identity admission

Transport telemetry v1 is a typed JSON contract with a checked-in golden
fixture. Every snapshot carries process start and observation times, configured
policy, accepted/denied connections, and per-operation plus
per-authenticated-identity attempted/allowed/denied/failed counts, request/response bytes,
current/peak in-flight work, and total/maximum duration. Counter saturation sets
an explicit overflow flag rather than wrapping. It retains no frame content,
credentials, errors, prompts, embeddings, or artifact bytes.

The same admission coordinator enforces a bounded identity table, global and
per-identity concurrency, and a fixed-window request budget before application
dispatch. A dropped or timed-out guard records failed work. Receiver telemetry
reports durable inventory separately from process-local begin/chunk/complete,
receipt replay, quota, GC, denial, and failure counters. Consensus trace health
reports observation phases, commit acknowledgements, cursor conflicts, leader
changes, unavailable leaders, denials, and failures. Node control v4 returns
all three sections under one observation time and binds the status to the
configured project, cluster, shard, Raft id, and canonical node id. This is
scrapeable operator/benchmark evidence; it is not substituted for canonical
runtime traces or hash-chained audit truth and resets explicitly on restart.

Connectome now supplies the first retained observation path. Its explicit
ingest endpoint validates the complete control-v4 status, denies a foreign
project, deduplicates the source-status digest, rejects observation-time and
same-process counter regression, and commits an immutable sample to the
project runtime. Each node has an independently verified sample sequence and
digest chain. Process-coordinate changes make the reset explicit and suppress
an invalid cross-process delta. Bounded history includes the last pre-window
sample per node, allowing the browser to reconstruct topology faithfully while
rewinding. This proves retained manual ingestion and inspection; it is not an
automatic scrape/export pipeline.

## What is not yet claimed

This gate still does not contain dynamic membership discovery, automatic
certificate issuance or Workload API streaming, durable supervisor generation,
automatic telemetry collection/export, multi-shard atomic commit, or
metadata-shard reshard cutover.
Application state currently proves ordered identity/CAS/digest semantics and
now atomically dispatches canonical `RuntimeCommit` transactions into native
RRD LSM and transfers that runtime state in file-backed Raft snapshots. The
native segment v3 separately bounds query residency with independently verified
blocks and a shared cache, while snapshot streaming bounds transfer copies.
Its synchronous mutex, prefix scans, and JSON protocol state are
correctness-first test implementations, not production throughput or footprint
claims. Commands are
limited to 1 MiB and physical snapshot envelopes to 1 GiB. The compact RPC
codec remains open; the disk-resident segment path is executable, while broader
mixed-workload and hardware reproduction remain promotion gates.

The four-process matrix now commits a project-scoped vector artifact through
the version-4 control protocol, stages its immutable bytes on all voters,
forces every possible source beyond the snapshot/purge boundary, and verifies
the fresh learner's activated snapshot, exact bytes, manifest, and durable
receipt after leadership changes. Node config v2 requires the project scope and
may configure transport admission and bounded Raft heartbeat/election timing;
control v4 accepts typed runtime commits,
denies a foreign scope, and exposes privacy-bounded operational telemetry.

The next M7 slice must extend that passing one-host process matrix to independent
hosts and real network/disk fault mechanisms, connect the passing credential
state machine to an attested Workload API source, and add automatic telemetry
collection/export. File-backed, bounded-memory snapshot creation/receipt,
resumable scoped artifact transfer, bounded receiver lifecycle, and
consensus-replicated transfer traces are closed for the fixture, but larger retained
segment/query/closure soak evidence is still required before high-volume
cluster claims.
Only that evidence can advance a Multi-AZ claim.
