# POAM-006 — installed product and attunement lifecycle

**Status:** active parent-owned POA&M detail
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha/poam-006`
**Owner:** [RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M](../rrflow-1.0-alpha.md)

This detail record is part of the canonical RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M. The parent
ledger owns priority and lifecycle status; this file cannot change either
independently.

## Observed deficiency

The source-built primary `rrflow` binary now owns deterministic install plan/apply,
installed serve, authenticated ready, read-only quick verify, and version. Exact-plan
retry recovers across eight typed durable stages without duplicating installation
authority, and the pre-canonical manifest, raw product CLI, development supervisor,
standalone security initializer, and server initializer are removed. The lifecycle is
still missing execution of its persisted pending attunement job, a committed deterministic
project-tree inventory, generic bundle-resident scaffolding and adapter bindings, real attunement phase
executors, configuration apply, full verify, canonical installed backup resolution,
repair, restore, ownership-safe uninstall, service installation, and a signed offline
platform distribution. The public apply boundary also still accepts an injected
installation timestamp; the primary CLI supplies its host wall clock, but a versioned
trusted-clock capability and rollback/skew/failure evidence do not exist. The retained
application-backup component is fail-closed open-existing code: it no longer creates a
database at the pre-canonical parent, but it does not yet accept the installed locator and
distribution binding.

## Impact

RRFlow has a coherent local pre-release startup spine, but it is not yet a repeatable
turnkey distribution. It cannot discover and attune a project durably, repair or restore
damaged state, remove only owned integration, or prove clean offline and cross-platform
operation. Unqualified process and Kubernetes controllers can still overstate readiness
or maintain lifecycle state outside the finished engine contract.

## Owning gates

D-01 through D-11, J-01 through J-05

Roadmap owners: [Gate D](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-d.md) and
[Gate J](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-j.md).

## Closure evidence

The D-01 single-primary-executable fresh/existing lifecycle passes deterministic plan,
no-write preview, apply, authenticated ready, commit, close/reopen, and baseline read-only
verification without checkout companions; old initializer/supervisor/doctor/create-on-open
success paths are absent. D-02 through D-05 prove durable attunement and inventory/index
work; D-11 proves safe repair/restore/uninstall; native release qualification passes in J.
