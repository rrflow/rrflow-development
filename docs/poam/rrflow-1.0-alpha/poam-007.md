# POAM-007 — installed specialization and seat identity

**Status:** active parent-owned POA&M detail
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha/poam-007`
**Owner:** [RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M](../rrflow-1.0-alpha.md)

This detail record is part of the canonical RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M. The parent
ledger owns priority and lifecycle status; this file cannot change either
independently.

## Observed deficiency

`AGENTS.md` is the repository instruction source and a useful seat/provider/representation
graph persists through reopen, but there is no installed digest-bound specialization
manifest or adapter-conformance proof across supported AI hosts. The current `MemoryEstate*`
names conflate seat identity with an estate, CLI defaults hardcode Clyffy instead of
consuming an installed specialization, the caller manually commits the identity plan, broad
snapshot reconstruction resolves it, and the authenticated
session/representation/authorization/routing path is not joined.

## Impact

Provider files can drift or claim invisible lifecycle behavior; a generic install can
accidentally acquire this repository's persona; or a caller can label itself as a seat
without one same-stamp authenticated and authorized causal operation.

## Closure evidence

Canonical seat naming is direct; the generic template has no persona/provider default; this
repository's specialization explicitly selects Clyffy; install atomically persists the seat
and approved representation inputs; provider stubs contain only verified forwarding
behavior; and every adapter resolves the same specialization digest, authenticates the exact
provider identity, resolves a visible representation at the operation stamp, independently
authorizes the operation, and records seat attribution through commit/reopen.
