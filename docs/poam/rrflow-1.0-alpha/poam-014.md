# POAM-014 — implementation-requirements traceability

**Status:** active parent-owned POA&M detail
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha/poam-014`
**Owner:** [RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M](../rrflow-1.0-alpha.md)

This detail record is part of the canonical RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M. The parent
ledger owns priority and lifecycle status; this file cannot change either
independently.

## Observed deficiency

Completed A-07 binds its starting revision's packages, public roots,
implementation modules, tests, fixtures, examples, benchmarks, accepted
invariants, canonical destinations, direct-removal obligations, and closed
causal-evidence vocabulary. Later engine packages have not yet supplied
complete equal-or-stronger replacement evidence for behavior still spread
across direct-convergence and parallel authorities.

The A-07 record is a frozen discovery baseline, not a global prose audit for
every later package to rewrite. Current path/digest discovery belongs to the
[generated repository inventory](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0-file-plan.jsonl),
while the [implementation-navigation owner](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0-execution/implementation-navigation.md)
and [change-authoring procedure](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0-execution/change-authoring.md)
define the package-local trace boundary.

## Impact

Without carrying that trace through each bounded runtime package, a move,
merge, rename, compile, or deletion can still appear complete while useful
semantics or characterization evidence is omitted from the one RRFlow
implementation. Growing one global audit would become stale and obscure which
package actually authorized a replacement.

## Owning gates

C, D-05, E, F, G, H, J-02

Roadmap owners: [Gate C](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-c.md),
[Gate D](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-d.md),
[Gate E](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-e.md),
[Gate F](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-f.md),
[Gate G](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-g.md),
[Gate H](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-h.md), and
[Gate J](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-j.md).

## Closure evidence

Preserve A-07 unchanged as its accepted baseline. Before each later package
edits, moves, merges, or deletes implementation, its planning-only active
change record must map current behavior, source modules, characterization
tests, canonical destination, owning gate, removal obligation, and smallest
failure oracle. Its linked package journal must report the resulting behavior,
changed paths, replacement tests, failures, omissions, and exact accepted
revision.

Remove a prior path only after the package proves equal-or-stronger semantic,
fault, resource, reopen, and causal evidence at the canonical destination.
Regenerate the Git-backed inventory for navigation and digest facts; do not
append a second global prose implementation trace.
