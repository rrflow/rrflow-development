# POAM-021 — local process-control authority

**Status:** active parent-owned POA&M detail
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha/poam-021`
**Owner:** [RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M](../rrflow-1.0-alpha.md)

This detail record is part of the canonical RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M. The parent
ledger owns priority and lifecycle status; this file cannot change either
independently.

## Observed deficiency

Local RRD process control is split between `rrd-estate::LocalProcessDriver`, a standalone
deployment-catalogue generator, static direct-store reconciliation plus
`rrd-estate-controller`, and a second `rrflow-cli` development supervisor. They create
private JSON process/catalogue/supervisor state, accept arbitrary physical roots and caller
time/configuration, run `rrd-server initialize` before start, treat file existence as
readiness/shutdown completion, and do not bind the authenticated digest to the exact
executed image. Plaintext environment values and unbounded diagnostic logs/tails also cross
this boundary.

## Impact

Process launch can become a second installation, storage, and lifecycle authority; a
replaced executable or forged/stale marker can be trusted; restart recovery can depend on
private files instead of engine state; secrets can leak; and diagnostics can exhaust the
host. Passing PID-reuse and effect-gap tests can falsely qualify this topology.

## Closure evidence

Make `rrd-estate` pure; implement one outward local-process adapter consuming only immutable
installed, fenced effect plans; bind artifact digest to the executed image; use
authenticated challenge-bound readiness/control receipts; commit canonical
intent/observations/receipts through `RrdEngine`; remove both supervisors,
catalogue/controller binaries, process JSON, marker authority, initializer, arbitrary-path
entry points, and successful prior shapes; then pass MX/KV semantic, every effect/crash gap,
path/image replacement, PID reuse, forged receipt, timeout, disk/resource/secret,
public-surface, clean offline install, and final Linux/Windows/macOS corpora.
