# POAM-045 — vector search returns a vector's old version after it moves to another collection

**Status:** active parent-owned POA&M detail
**Coordinate:** `rrflow://rrflow-instance/data/poam/rrflow-1.0-alpha/poam-045`
**Owner:** [RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M](../rrflow-1.0-alpha.md)

This detail record is part of the canonical RRFlow 1.0 alpha POA&M. The parent
ledger owns priority and lifecycle status; this file cannot change either
independently.

## Observed deficiency

Observed at development/main `81fce08e` while writing E-04b's oracle
(`rrd-engine` `engine::tests::vector_index::turboquant_overlay`):

- **The repro.** A vector identity is put in collection `documents`, then put
  again in collection `archive`, with the same valid time. An exact search of
  `documents` still returns the identity, scored with its `documents` version.
- **Why.** `RrdEngine::search_vectors_at`
  (`rrd-engine/src/engine/vector/search.rs`) keeps a canonical version only if
  that version names the requested collection (`vector_matches_collection`),
  and it does this before the exact scorer resolves each identity's latest
  visible version. The identity's newer version names `archive`, so it is
  removed first, and the superseded `documents` version is then the latest
  candidate left.
- **Point retrieval does it the other way round.**
  `RrdEngine::retrieve_vector_points` (`engine/vector/points.rs`) resolves the
  latest valid version first and then filters its address. It notes that "a
  collection/name move must not resurrect an older matching version".
- **Accelerators.** By reading the code: HNSW base candidates and the scalar,
  product, binary and TurboQuant generations are built from the old version,
  and nothing in the old collection records the move. So the same version
  returns through those paths.
- **What the store already has.** The commit path records a move as a removal
  from the old source (`VectorSourceDelta` with `before` and no `after`, in
  `rrd-store/src/access/vector.rs`).

## Impact

A vector that moved out of a collection is still found there, with content the
estate has replaced. Search and point retrieval disagree about which version
is current.

## Owning gates

C-04, E-04

C-04 owns direct current and temporal reads; vector search must resolve the
visible version before it filters an address, as point retrieval does. E-04
owns the accelerator generations and their delta overlay; a move out of a
source must remove the identity from that source's candidates.

Roadmap owners: [Gate C](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-c.md) and
[Gate E](../../roadmap/rrflow-1.0/gate-e.md).

## Closure evidence

- **A search oracle.** After moves in both directions, at valid times before
  and after the move, exact, HNSW, quantized and TurboQuant search return an
  identity only from the collection its visible version names, and equal
  point retrieval at the same stamp.
- **Delta parity.** A source's deltas and its search candidates agree on every
  move.
